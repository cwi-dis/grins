In the following, replace CVSROOT with the actual value.  At Oratrix,
the value is
	oratrix.oratrix.nl:/ufs/mm/CVSPRIVATE
Other possibilities are values of the type
	:pserver:USERNAME@oratrix.oratrix.nl:/ufs/mm/CVSPRIVATE
where USERNAME has to be replaced by the actual value.  In this case
you need to login first (once).

Prerequisites

MacCvs (Version 3.1 is known to be stable, later ones have
occasionally had problems) from http://www.wincvs.org/
Metroworks Codewarrior Pro 5.3

Getting the Sources

Create a directory where you're going to put the sources. Use the
relevant MacCVS commands to create the following directories (Oratrix
CVS is the CVSROOT explained above; Python CVS is
:pserver:anonymous@cvs.python.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/python, password
""; PythonMac CVS is
:pserver:ropython@pythoncvs.oratrix.nl:/hosts/mm/CVSREMOTE, password
"geheim"):

...:Python			Python source distribution (Python CVS, from python/dist/src)
          :Extensions:img	(Oratrix CVS)
          :Mac              (PythonMac CVS)
   :GUSI2			(Oratrix CVS or PythonMac CVS, from lib-src)
   :imglibs			(Oratrix CVS, from lib-src/*)
   :cmif			(Oratrix CVS, use tag smil-boston, from mm/demo)

Building Python and the applets

Build the libraries MacPython needs, :Python:Mac:Build:buildlibs.prj
does this (ignore errors about missing gdbm and Tcl/Tk libraries). Next
build MacPython, :Python:Mac:Demo:building.html has instructions for
this. Extend PythonInterpreter's memory allocation to 30MB or so (with Finder
"Get Info") so the build process works later on.

From this point you should be able to run the scripts (maceditor.py, macplayer.py, etc)
in :cmif:Build:mac. You can also build applets for these by dropping them on
BuildApplet.

Adapting splash screens and version numbers

XXX This section to-be-done.

Building the frozen versions

Run the macbuild.py script (from :cmif:Build:mac). Select the products
you want to freeze and build, go! The player should run from any
location, the editor needs to be either in the toplevel cmif directory
or in the :cmif:Build:mac directory or it won't be able to find
templates and icons.

Building the installer

The installers are created with Installer VISE. The .vct files, which are
used to create the installers, live in :cmif:Build:mac:installer.

To build an installer first update the files in the vct archive using the
"Update" command. This gives you a dialog telling you which files have been changed,
added or removed. Check that this is correct. Next use the "Build" command,
this creates both the installer and the BinHexed version of the installer.
Finally use the "Remove compressed data" command to remove the actual data from
the .vct file, so that when you check it in to CVS it isn't a 6 MB file.

XXX Version numbers in the installer may also need to be adapted for a new release,
this information to-be-supplied later.
