    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Player for Macintosh Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS player for
      Macintosh, Release 0.2, patchlevel 0. More
      information on GR<i>i</i>NS can be obtained at <A
	HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS">http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS</A>, or 
      by email to <A
	HREF="mailto:grins-request@cwi.nl">grins-request@cwi.nl</A>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What (sparse) documentation on GR<i>i</i>NS is available at this 
      time can also be found on the homepage.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      You need a PPC or 68K macintosh with a minimum of 16Mb of RAM
      and System 7.1. For decent multimedia performance, however, you will
      probably need at least a 100Mhz PPC with 32Mb of RAM. You may
      want to play with the application size through the "File info"
      window in the Finder. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You need
      MacTCP or Open Transport to access documents over the net
      (included in MacOS since System 7.5).
    </p>
    <p>
      GR<i>i</i>NS uses QuickTime and Sound Manager for multimedia
      playback. You need QuickTime 2.5 or later. QuickTime 3 includes
      MPEG support, for QuickTime 2.5 you have to get a separate MPEG
      extension. QuickTime and the extension can be obtained from <A
	HREF="http://quicktime.apple.com">quicktime.apple.com</A>.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation instructions</h3>
    <p>
      There are none, really: unpacking the StuffIt archive is all you
      need to do. You may want to tell your text editor to save
      documents with creator GRIN, type TEXT, to open them
      automatically with the player when you double-click them.
    </p>

    <h3>Customization</h3>
    <p>
      One aspect of GR<i>i</i>NS can be customized: the handling of
      the test attributes such as bitrates and language (see section
      4.4 of the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/">SMIL
	specification</a>). See the <A
	HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/examples.html">examples
	section</A> on the homepage for details.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>The SMIL language</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the complete
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/">SMIL 1.0</a>
      definition except where noted <a href="#unsup">below</a>.  A
      conforming SMIL document can be correctly parsed, but a few
      features are not implemented.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform dependencies in media handling</h3>
    <p>
      There are some differences between the various platforms.  See
      the <a
	href="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/relnotes/supported.html">chart
	of supported media types</a> on the GR<i>i</i>NS website
      for the supported media types on the various supported
      platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Access methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the following access methods
      (URL schemes).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported
      by the GR<i>i</i>NS player.  Documents that make use of these
      features are parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform-specific issues</h3>
    <p>
      There are also a number of features that are not supported on
      all platforms, or not supported identically. The following
      problems are known for the player on the Macintosh:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Clip-begin, clip-end and looping are not supported on video items.
      </li>
      <li>
	Double-clicking a document while the player is already running 
	does not work. Open the file from the player File menu in
	stead.
      </li>
      <li>
	HTML support is very weak, only a few of the major tags are
	supported, and not even fully.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As more issues are reported they are added to the <A
	HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/relnotes.html">release notes</A> 
      section on the home page.
