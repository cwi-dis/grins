This file contains (terse) instructions on how to build GRiNS
and CMIFed on the macintosh.

Start out with a file tree that looks like this:
...:Python			Python source distribution (Python's CVS)
          :Extensions:img	(CWI CVS)
          :Mac                  (CWI CVS)
   :gdbm			(CWI CVS)
   :CWGUSI                      Version 1.8.4, with mods from Python:Mac
   :imglibs			(CWI CVS lib-src)
   :cmif			(CWI CVS)

First build CWGUSI, gdbm, the image libraries and Python itself. The
instructions for this are in the Python:Mac:Demo folder. Test Python.

To build cmifed and grins go to the cmif:Build:mac folder.

You may have to rebuild the attrdefs.rsrc files. You can do this with
mkattrdefsresource.py script (XXXX but that script is old, so it may
need a bit of massaging).

Next, running the macbuild.py script should do the complete build.
In case it doesn't work, here are the steps it does:
1. Freeze macgrins.py into the build.macgrins folder. To do this by
   hand run Python:mac:Tools:macfreeze:macfreeze.py, select
   macgrins.py as source, and select "CW project and source".
2. Build grins, by opening macgrins.prj (in build.macgrins) and
   building the GRiNS FAT target.
3. Freeze maccmifed.py into build.maccmif.
4. Build maccmifed.
