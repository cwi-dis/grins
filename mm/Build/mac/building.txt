This file contains (terse) instructions on how to build GRiNS
and CMIFed on the macintosh.

Start out with a file tree that looks like this:
...:Python			Python source distribution (Python's CVS)
          :Extensions:img	(CWI CVS)
          :Mac                  (CWI CVS)
   :gdbm			(CWI CVS)
   :CWGUSI                      Version 1.8.4, with mods from Python:Mac
   :imglibs			(CWI CVS lib-src)
   :cmif			(CWI CVS)

First build CWGUSI, gdbm, the image libraries and Python itself. The
instructions for this are in the Python:Mac:Demo folder. Test Python.

To build cmifed and grins go to the cmif:Build:mac folder.

First you have to build the balloons.rsrc and playercontrols.rsrc
files. Run the project balloons.prj in the balloons folder and
the project playercontrols.prj in the icons folder.

Next you may have to rebuild the attrdefs.py file. To do this,
run macgrins.py once.


Next, running the macbuild.py script should do the complete build.
In case it doesn't work, here are the steps it does:
1. Freeze macplayer.py into the build.player folder. To do this by
   hand run Python:mac:Tools:macfreeze:macfreeze.py, select
   macgrins.py as source, and select "CW project and source".
2. Build player, by opening player.prj (in build.player) and
   building the GRiNS FAT target.
3. Freeze maceditor.py into build.editor.
4. Build editor.
