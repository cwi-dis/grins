Welcome to Oratrix GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5. GRiNS for RealSystem G2
lets you create, edit and preview SMIL presentations and is tailored towards
presentations that will be viewed with RealPlayer G2.

This is a time-limited beta test distribution. You are strongly
advised to check the release notes to see what works and what doesn't
work. Feedback on this beta release is eagerly awaited, send to
grins-support@oratrix.com please.

GRiNS for RealSystem G2 is available in a Pro version and a Lite version,
and for various platforms. See the Oratrix website, www.oratrix.com, for details.

In order to preview your presentations you need RealPlayer G2 or later, either
in the Basic or Plus version. See the RealNetworks website www.real.com
for details.

In order to be able to run GRiNS you need a license key. You have been provided
with such a key when you bought your copy of GRiNS or downloaded your evaluation
version. You have to enter this key when you first start GRiNS.

The document QuickStart.pdf contains information on how to use the
editor.  You need Adobe Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com/) to read 
the Quick Start Guide.  There are also tutorials on the ORATRiX web
site. Release notes are available in the file relnotes.html in the same folder
as the application.

RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
