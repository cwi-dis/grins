Welcome to Oratrix GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5. GRiNS for
RealSystem G2 lets you create, edit and preview SMIL presentations and
is tailored towards presentations that will be viewed with RealPlayer
G2.

The minimum system requirements for this distribution are a 200Mhz PPC 
Macintosh with 32 Mb of real memory, 65 Mb of virtual memory and MacOS 
8.1. 64Mb of real memory and MacOS 8.5 are recommended, and a faster
processor will result in better preview playback.

GRiNS for RealSystem G2 is available in a Pro version and a Lite version,
and for various platforms. See the Oratrix website, www.oratrix.com,
for details.

In order to preview your presentations you need RealPlayer G2 or later, either in
the Basic or Plus version. See the RealNetworks website www.real.com for details.
RealPlayer 7 is preferred on your editing machine, as RealPlayer G2 has some
problems with playing captions in the preview player (G2 is fine for playing the
final presentation). Operation of GRiNS for RealSystem G2 on a machine without
RealPlayer installed may be possible with some restrictions, but this is not a
supported configuration.

In order to be able to run GRiNS you need a license key. You have been provided
with such a key when you bought your copy of GRiNS or downloaded your evaluation
version. You have to enter this key when you first start GRiNS.

The document QuickStart.pdf contains information on how to use the
editor.  You need Adobe Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com/) to read 
the Quick Start Guide.  The Tutorials.pdf document contains more elaborate tutorials
that will show you most of the features in GRiNS. Release notes are available in the 
file relnotes.html in the same folder as the application.

RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
