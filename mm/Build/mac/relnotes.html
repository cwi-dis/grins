    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS for Macintosh Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS editor and
      player for the Macintosh, Release 0.5, patchlevel 6. More information on
      GR<i>i</i>NS can be obtained at <A
      HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS</A>,
      or by email to <A
      HREF="mailto:grins-request@oratrix.com">grins-request@oratrix.com</A>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What (sparse) documentation on GR<i>i</i>NS is available at this 
      time can also be found on the homepage.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      For decent performance you probably need at least a 100Mhz
      PowerPC with 32Mb, but even on a 68020 mac with 16Mb of virtual
      memory things will work (albeit slowly). You need about 15Mb of
      free diskspace. You need MacOS 7.5 (but 7.1 may work) and QuickTime
      2.5 (QuickTime 3 or higher if you want MPEG video playback).
    </p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Bug reports and other technical feedback should be sent to <A
      HREF="mailto:grins-support@oratrix.com">grins-support@oratrix.com</A>,

      section</A> on the homepage for details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Non-technical feedback should be sent to <A

    </p>
    
    <h3>Example documents</h3>
    
    <p>
      A number of example documents can be found in the Examples folder. More
      examples will be added to the <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">GRiNS
      home page</a> over time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>License keys</h3>
    
    <p>
      To start the editor you need a license key. You may have been provided with a
      temporary license key in the same message in which you received the password for
      the download area. If not you can send an empty mail message to
      <a href="mailto:evalutation-license@oratrix.com">evalutation-license@oratrix.com</a>
      and we will send you a time-limited key, or we will mail you details on how to
      proceed.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform dependencies in media handling</h3>
    <p>
      There are some differences between the various platforms.  See
      the <a
	href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/Software/GS-supported1.html">chart
	of supported media types</a> on the GR<i>i</i>NS website
      for the supported media types on the various supported
      platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Access methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the following access methods
      (URL schemes).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported
      by the GR<i>i</i>NS player.  Documents that make use of these
      features are parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mac user interface open issues</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on the settings in the MacOS General Preferences
      control panel the <i>New</i> command will sometimes not display
      the contents of the Templates folder but of some other random
      folder. Navigating to the Templates folder by hand should fix
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popup menus near the bottom of the screen tend to come up mostly 
      empty. They do scroll, however, so all menu entries are
      selectable, it is merely not very pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editing in the layout view is <i>very</i> clunky. This will be
      fixed shortly. For this version, three points are important to remember:
      <i>(1)</i> resizing is done through the control-click popup menu in the player window;
      <i>(2)</i> The popup menu commands operate on the channel (region) under the
      mouse, <i>not</i> on the channel that is highlighted;
      <i>(3)</i> in case of overlapping channels it may be impossible to select
      the one you want to resize (the workaround is to temporarily move the other
      channel out of the way).
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally a spurious popup menu is displayed when scrolling.
      Ignore this menu and there should be no ill effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resizing the structure or timeline view will reset the horizontal
      and vertical detail settings to fit the window.
    </p>
    
    <h3><A NAME="problems">HTML problems</A></h3>
    <p>
      The HTML renderer in GRiNS for the Macintosh is very limited.
    </p>

    <h3>Other open issues issues</h3>
    <p>
      There are also a number of features that are not supported on
      all platforms, or not supported identically.
    </p>

    <p>
      As issues are reported they are added to the release
      notes and open issues
      sections on the <A
      HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">GRiNS home page</A>.
