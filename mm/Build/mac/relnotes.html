	<h3>New features in this release</h>
	
	<p>
	  Conversion of QuickTime and MPEG movies to RealVideo now works, although
	  only the video track is converted, not the audio track.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
	  The previous beta release had serious memory leaks leading to crashes. These
	  have all been fixed (to our knowledge: please report to us if there are
	  still problems).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Lots of minor bug fixes, interface enhancements, etc.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Open issues</h3>
    
    <p>
      PNG image files are supported in this release, but some PNG images have trouble
      with the colors.
    </p>

      There appear to be occasional problems when using GRiNS with RealPlayer 7
      that we are investigating. Please send us feedback on this issue, at
      grins-support@oratrix.com. Often when preview play does not work 
      trying it a second time <i>will</i> work.
      These problems are specific to RealPlayer 7,
      RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) works fine. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
      You should also have RealPlayer 6.0.6.17 or later installed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
