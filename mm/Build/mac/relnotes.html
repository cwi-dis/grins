	<h3>New features in this release</h>
	
	<p>
	  RealFlash playback now works.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
	  The "Properties" dialog is now more in line with the documentation (and the WIndows
	  version), and all main bugs in the properties dialog (not being able to reach channel
	  properties, setting multiple target audiences) have been fixed. The few remaining issues
	  (like missing help strings) should be addressed in the next beta.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The editor now gives a warning when it runs low on memory. There are still some
      memory leak problems in this release, but at least now you have the option of saveing
      your work and restarting.
    </p>

    <h3>Open issues</h3>
    
    <p>
      This beta release does not do conversion of Quicktime or MPEG movie files to
      RealVideo yet. The workaround is to convert your videos using another tool,
      like RealProducer, and using the converted files in your presentation. Preview
      playback of RealVideo files does work as expected. Conversion of all other
      media types should also work.
    </p>

    <p>
      PNG image files are not supported in this release.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There appear to be occasional problems when using GRiNS with RealPlayer 7
      that we are investigating. Please send us feedback on this issue, at
      grins-support@oratrix.com. Often when preview play does not work 
      trying it a second time <i>will</i> work.
      These problems are specific to RealPlayer 7,
      RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) works fine. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
      You should also have RealPlayer 6.0.6.17 or later installed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
