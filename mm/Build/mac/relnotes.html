      for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5beta
      for Macintosh.  This file contains release notes for both the Light and the
      Pro version.
      
      For a more up-to-date version of
      these notes, see <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS</a>.

    <h3>Open issues</h3>
    
    <p>
      This beta release does not do conversion of Quicktime or MPEG movie files to
      RealVideo yet. The workaround is to convert your videos using another tool,
      like RealProducer, and using the converted files in your presentation. Preview
      playback of RealVideo files does work as expected. Conversion of all other
      media types should also work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
	  The "Properties" dialog has each property on a separate page, and does
	  not have the tab-based interface described in the documentation. This will
	  be fixed in the final release.
    </p>

      There appear to be occasional problems when using GRiNS with RealPlayer 7
      that we are investigating. Please send us feedback on this issue, at
      grins-support@oratrix.com. These problems are specific to RealPlayer 7,
      RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) works fine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
      You should also have RealPlayer 6.0.6.17 or later installed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
