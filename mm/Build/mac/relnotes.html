    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Editor for SMIL Release 1.0 Release Notes for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GRiNS Editor and Player for
      SMIL Release 1.0 for Macintosh.  These release notes were last
      updated on August 27 1999.  For a more up-to-date version of
      these notes, look

    </p>

    <h3>Mac user interface open issues</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on the settings in the MacOS General Preferences
      control panel the <i>New</i> command will sometimes not display
      the contents of the Templates folder but of some other random
      folder. Navigating to the Templates folder by hand should fix
      this.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Attempting to play back RealMedia datatypes that are not supported by the
      version of the G2 player that is installed on your system may result in a crash.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Popup menus near the bottom of the screen tend to come up mostly 
      empty. They do scroll, however, so all menu entries are
      selectable, it is merely not very pretty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The HTML renderer in GRiNS for the Macintosh is very limited.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Under low-memory conditions you may receive incorrect error messages when playing
      media items. Serious low-memory conditions may lead to a crash.
    </p>

    <h3>Access Methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS Editor and Player for SMIL supports the
      following access methods (URL schemes):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is possible to create and edit documents that make use of
      other access methods (in particular the rtsp access method), but
      they cannot be previewed.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL Features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported by the
      GR<i>i</i>NS Editor and Player for SMIL.  Documents that make
      use of these features are parsed correctly, but the features are
      ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>
