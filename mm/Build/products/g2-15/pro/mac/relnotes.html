    <h1>GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5.1 Release Notes
      for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5.1
      for Macintosh.  This file contains release notes for both the Lite and the
      Pro version. More up-to-date notes might be available at
      <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">http://www.oratrix.com/GR<i>i</i>NS</a>.

    </p>
    
    <h3>Changes since release 1.5</h3>
    
    <p>
      It is now possible to create hyperlinks to external documents from all media
      types.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      GRiNS now checks whether a .grins file was created with a compatible
      version and gives the option of going ahead or cancelling.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anchor start and end times are now obeyed during preview playback.
    </p>

	<h3>Open Issues</h3>
	
	<p>
	  RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) has some problems that influence
	  GRiNS, notably some trouble playing back captions. Some RealPlayer 7 betas
	  had a different set of problems. All of these are solved by updating to the
	  final RealPlayer 7 release. This GRiNS release should now work flawlessly with
	  RealPlayer 7. Playback of the final presentation should be fine with
	  RealPlayer G2 too, the problems only affect preview playback.
	</p>
	
    <p>
      Some PNG images are rendered with incorrect colors. The workaround is to
      convert those PNGs to a different format (TIFF, for instance) before using
      them in GRiNS.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
     </p>
    
    <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
    </p>
    
	<p>
	  The preview player will not always understand hyperlinks in items with low z-order.
	  Even though the items are not currently obscured, and even though the mouse cursor
	  does change to a hand cursor you will not be able to follow the link.
	</p>
	
    <p>
      This release has occasional problems with finding media items in presentations
      that live inside the GRiNS application folder. The workaround for your own documents
      is not to save them in the GRiNS folder. The workaround for the EUROs.grins
      tutorial example (tutorial 6) is to open it through drag&drop, not through the
      file->open command.
