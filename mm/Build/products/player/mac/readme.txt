Welcome to Oratrix GRiNS Player, version 1.5.1. The GRiNS Player lets
you play back SMIL presentations. It is a companion product to the
GRiNS for SMIL editor, with which you can easily create SMIL presentations.

The minimum system requirements for this distribution are a 200Mhz PPC 
Macintosh with 32 Mb of real memory, 65 Mb of virtual memory and MacOS 
8.1. 64Mb of real memory and MacOS 8.5 are recommended, and a faster
processor will result in better preview playback.

The GRiNS product family consists of a set of playback and authoring tools for various
playback engines and computer platforms. See the Oratrix website, www.oratrix.com,
for details.

There is no separate documentation for the GRiNS Player, but the GRiNS for SMIL documentation
contains some information pertaining to the player. It can be obtained from the
website.
