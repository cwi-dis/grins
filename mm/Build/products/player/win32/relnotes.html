    <h1>GRiNS Player, version 1.5.1 Release Notes
      for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GRiNS Player, version 1.5.1
      for Macintosh.

	<h3>Open Issues</h3>
	<p>
	  RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) has some problems that influence
	  GRiNS, notably some trouble playing back captions. Some RealPlayer 7 betas
	  had a different set of problems. All of these are solved by updating to the
	  final RealPlayer 7 release. This release should now work flawlessly with
	  RealPlayer 7. Playback of the final presentation should be fine with
	  RealPlayer G2 too, the problems only affect preview playback.

      Some PNG images are rendered with incorrect colors. The workaround is to
      convert those PNGs to a different format (TIFF, for instance) before using
      them in GRiNS.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Transparency of HTML channels is not always handled correct. The problem does not
      occur if you set the background color of the HTML channel to be the same as the
      background color of the underlying channel.

      <em>If you want to use RealMedia playback:</em>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
