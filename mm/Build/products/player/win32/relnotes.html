<h1>
GR<i>i</i>NS Player for SMIL 1.0 Version 1.5.1 Release Notes for Windows</h1>
These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS Player for SMIL 1.0 Version
1.5.1 for Windows.
<h3>
Windows User Interface Open Issues</h3>
GR<i>i</i>NS can render HTML either through the Internet Explorer HTML
control (part of IE4) or the built-in WebsterPro HTML control. This is
user-selectable throught the Preferences dialog. In some circumstances
the IE control causes the Player to crash. If this happens, use the WebsterPro
control.
<p>Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features but
always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is a HTML 3 control
only, and has problems with some things like using tags in URLs and accessing
files via network neighborhood naming. Both controls can be slow rendering
the data on the screen.
<p>If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine (e.g. <tt>*.aiff</tt>
or <tt>*.mpeg</tt>) try installing Active Movie, also sometimes known as
Media Player. It is included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and for Windows
95 you should see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/mediaplayer/default.asp">Microsoft's
Media Player download page</a> for details.
<h3>
Open Issues</h3>
If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in the bottom
right corner of the preview player to indicate that not all text is shown.
<p>The SMIL standard does not permit a jump (hyperlink) into a switch node.
GR<i>i</i>NS currently does not prevent the user from creating such hyperlinks
and also does not warn about them.
<p>Windows NT does not allow playback of two separate audio channels simultaneously.
Windows 98 does not have this problem.
<h3>
<a NAME="unsup"></a>Unsupported SMIL Features</h3>
There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported by the GR<i>i</i>NS
Player for SMIL. Documents that make use of these features are parsed correctly,
but the features are ignored.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>fit="fill"</tt> and <tt>fit="scroll"</tt> attribute values in <tt>region</tt>
element.</li>

<li>
<tt>name="pics-label"</tt> attribute value in <tt>meta</tt> element.</li>

<li>
<tt>alt</tt> attribute in media object elements.</li>

<li>
<tt>fill</tt> attribute.</li>
</ul>
