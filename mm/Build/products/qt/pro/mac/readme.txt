Welcome to Oratrix GRiNS for QuickTime, version 1.5beta. GRiNS for
QuickTime lets you create, edit and preview SMIL presentations and is targeted
at QuickTime 4.1 or later. This is an alfa release: it is not feature-complete
and there are probably various bugs as well.

The minimum system requirements for this distribution are a 200Mhz PPC
Macintosh with 32 Mb of memory and MacOS 8.1. 64Mb of real memory and
MacOS 8.5 are recommended, and a faster processor will result in better
preview playback.

GRiNS for QuickTime is one of a set of authoring products for various
playback engines and computer platforms. See the Oratrix website, www.oratrix.com,
for details.

entries and the set of properties on media items will differ this documentation should
