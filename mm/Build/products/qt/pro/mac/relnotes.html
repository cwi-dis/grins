    <h1>GRiNS for QuickTime, version 1.5beta Release Notes
      for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for QuickTime, version 1.5beta
      for Macintosh. It allows you to author SMIL presentations which can be
      played back with QuickTime 4.1 or later.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      This release is not feature-complete, and is guaranteed to contain numerous
      bugs:-)
    </p>
    
	<h3>Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
	  The Publish command copies the media items but it does not convert them
	  to quicktime-compatible formats. Also, the user is responsible for making 
	  sure the source format is not incompatible with the target bandwidth. A
	  next release will do these conversions.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      The current QuickTime player, version 4.1, often appears to put each SMIL
      media item on its own QuickTime track. The effect of this is that complex
      SMIL presentations may be rather slow in starting up. If this behaviour is
      not fixed by Apple in the foreseeable future we may attempt a workaround.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The QuickStart guide and tutorials included in this installer are not specifically
	  for GRiNS for QuickTime, they are for the general GRiNS for SMIL product. They
	  should help you with understanding the GRiNS workflow, however, even though some
	  details, like the exact set of properties on each media item, may be different.
