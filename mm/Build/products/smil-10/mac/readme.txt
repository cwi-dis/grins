Welcome to Oratrix GRiNS for SMIL 1.0, version 1.5.1. GRiNS for
SMIL 1.0 lets you create, edit and preview SMIL presentations.

The minimum system requirements for this distribution are a 200Mhz PPC 
Macintosh with 32 Mb of real memory, 65 Mb of virtual memory and MacOS 
8.1. 64Mb of real memory and MacOS 8.5 are recommended, and a faster
processor will result in better preview playback.

GRiNS for SMIL 1.0 is one of a set of authoring products for various
playback engines and computer platforms. See the Oratrix website, www.oratrix.com,
for details.

While GRiNS for SMIL is not targeted specifically at RealNetworks G2 player (GRiNS for G2
has extra features to author and convert G2-specific media types) the preview player
in GRiNS for SMIL does support playback of G2-media.

In order to enable this feature you need RealPlayer G2 or later, either in
the Basic or Plus version. See the RealNetworks website www.real.com for details.
RealPlayer 7 is preferred on your editing machine, as RealPlayer G2 has some
problems with playing captions in the preview play.

In order to be able to run GRiNS you need a license key. You have been provided
with such a key when you bought your copy of GRiNS or downloaded your evaluation
version. You have to enter this key when you first start GRiNS.

The document QuickStart.pdf contains information on how to use the
editor.  You need Adobe Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com/) to read 
the Quick Start Guide.  The Tutorials.pdf document contains more elaborate tutorials
that will show you most of the features in GRiNS. Release notes are available in the 
file relnotes.html in the same folder as the application.
