    <h1>GRiNS for SMIL 1.0, version 1.5.1 Release Notes
      for Macintosh</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for SMIL 1.0, version 1.5.1
      for Macintosh.
    </p>
    
<h3>
Changes since Version 1.0</h3>
There have been too many changes since 1.0 to list them all.&nbsp; Some
of the more important ones are listed below.
<p>The user interface for part of the Editor has changed considerably.
The user interface is now in line with GR<i>i</i>NS 1.5 for G2.
<ul>
<li>
Time in the Structure View is now left-to-right instead of top-to-bottom,
to align with the time flow in the Timeline View.</li>

<li>
Property editing dialogs are completely overhauled.</li>
</ul>
There is now a command to upload the finished document plus data objects
to a web server.
<p>The GR<i>i</i>NS Tutorials are now included in the GR<i>i</i>NS installer.
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS now saves the document in a file with the <tt>.grins</tt>
extensions instead of the <tt>.smil</tt> extension. This has the advantage
that GR<i>i</i>NS can coexist with other players for SMIL documents.
<p>Start and end times on anchors are now implemented.

	<h3>Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Some PNG images are rendered with incorrect colors. The workaround is to
      convert those PNGs to a different format (TIFF, for instance) before using
      them in GRiNS.
    </p>
        
     <p>
      Occasionally there may be problems with popup menus showing the wrong content
      if you have products installed that add global menus to the menubar, such as
      Palm Desktop. If this happens clicking a different menu once will make the
      problem go away.
    </p>
    
   <p>
      <em>If you want to use RealMedia playback:</em>
      RealNetworks suggest having at least 32Mb of real memory and 64Mb of
      virtual memory. We strongly suggest you follow these guidelines, as
      low-memory conditions may otherwise result in rather spectacular crashes.
     </p>
    
	<p>
	  RealPlayer G2 (also known as RealPlayer 6) has some problems that influence
	  GRiNS, notably some trouble playing back captions. Some RealPlayer 7 betas
	  had a different set of problems. All of these are solved by updating to the
	  final RealPlayer 7 release.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Using the <i>Edit Content</i> command from the <i>Edit</i> menu starts
the program registered for that file type. This may not always be an Editor.
</p>

<p>If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in the
bottom right corner of the preview player to indicate that not all text
is shown.</p>

<p>The SMIL standard does not permit a jump (hyperlink) into a switch node.
GR<i>i</i>NS currently does not prevent the user from creating such hyperlinks
and also does not warn about them.</p>
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS can crash when invalid values are entered for the Clip
begin or Clip end properties in video nodes. Make sure that the values
are valid (or empty) before trying to play back a document using Clip begin
or Clip end.
<p>Partial anchors on video nodes can be created and are saved correctly,
but during playback in GR<i>i</i>NS, the whole video region is sensitive
instead of just the anchor area.
<h3>
<a NAME="unsup"></a>Unsupported SMIL Features</h3>
There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported by the GR<i>i</i>NS
Editor and Player for SMIL. Documents that make use of these features are
parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>fit="fill"</tt> and <tt>fit="scroll"</tt> attribute values in <tt>region</tt>
element.</li>

<li>
<tt>name="pics-label"</tt> attribute value in <tt>meta</tt> element.</li>

<li>
<tt>alt</tt> attribute in media object elements.</li>

<li>
<tt>fill</tt> attribute.</li>
</ul>
