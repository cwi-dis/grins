<h1>
GR<i>i</i>NS Editor for SMIL 1.0 Version 1.5.1 Release Notes for Windows</h1>
These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS Editor and Player for
SMIL 1.0 Version 1.5.1 for Windows.
<h3>
Changes since Version 1.0</h3>
There have been too many changes since 1.0 to list them all.&nbsp; Some
of the more important ones are listed below.
<p>The user interface for part of the Editor has changed considerably.
The user interface is now in line with GR<i>i</i>NS 1.5 for G2.
<ul>
<li>
Time in the Structure View is now left-to-right instead of top-to-bottom,
to align with the time flow in the Timeline View.</li>

<li>
Property editing dialogs are completely overhauled.</li>
</ul>
There is now a command to upload the finished document plus data objects
to a web server.
<p>The GR<i>i</i>NS Tutorials are now included in the GR<i>i</i>NS installer.
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS now saves the document in a file with the <tt>.grins</tt>
extensions instead of the <tt>.smil</tt> extension. This has the advantage
that GR<i>i</i>NS can coexist with other players for SMIL documents.
<p>Start and end times on anchors are now implemented.
<h3>
Windows User Interface Open Issues</h3>
GR<i>i</i>NS can render HTML either through the Internet Explorer HTML
control (part of IE4) or the built-in WebsterPro HTML control. This is
user-selectable throught the Preferences dialog. In some circumstances
the IE control causes the Player/Editor to crash. If this happens, use
the WebsterPro control.
<p>Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features but
always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is a HTML 3 control
only, and has problems with some things like using tags in URLs and accessing
files via network neighborhood naming. Both controls can be slow rendering
the data on the screen.
<p>If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine (e.g. <tt>*.aiff</tt>
or <tt>*.mpeg</tt>) try installing Active Movie, also sometimes known as
Media Player. It is included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and for Windows
95 you should see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/mediaplayer/default.asp">Microsoft's
Media Player download page</a> for details.
<h3>
Open Issues</h3>
Using the <i>Edit Content</i> command from the <i>Edit</i> menu starts
the program registered for that file type. This may not always be an Editor.
<p>If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in the
bottom right corner of the preview player to indicate that not all text
is shown.
<p>The SMIL standard does not permit a jump (hyperlink) into a switch node.
GR<i>i</i>NS currently does not prevent the user from creating such hyperlinks
and also does not warn about them.
<p>Windows NT does not allow playback of two separate audio channels simultaneously.
Windows 98 does not have this problem.
<p>Windows that were hidden behind other windows may pop up at seemingly
random moments. Move your windows so that they don't fully overlap. In
that way you can easily get back to the window you were working with.
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS can crash when invalid values are entered for the Clip
begin or Clip end properties in video nodes. Make sure that the values
are valid (or empty) before trying to play back a document using Clip begin
or Clip end.
<p>Partial anchors on video nodes can be created and are saved correctly,
but during playback in GR<i>i</i>NS, the whole video region is sensitive
instead of just the anchor area.
<h3>
<a NAME="unsup"></a>Unsupported SMIL Features</h3>
There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported by the GR<i>i</i>NS
Editor and Player for SMIL. Documents that make use of these features are
parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>fit="fill"</tt> and <tt>fit="scroll"</tt> attribute values in <tt>region</tt>
element.</li>

<li>
<tt>name="pics-label"</tt> attribute value in <tt>meta</tt> element.</li>

<li>
<tt>alt</tt> attribute in media object elements.</li>

<li>
<tt>fill</tt> attribute.</li>
</ul>
