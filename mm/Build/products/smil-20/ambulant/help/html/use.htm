<blockquote> 
  <p span class="ProductHeader"><a name="use_open"></a>Opening files</p>
  <p span class="Normal">Opening files for playing in the Player can be achieved 
    in a number of ways. You may use the commands <b>Open...</b> and<b> Open URL...</b> 
    from the <b>File</b> menu, or if you have opened the file recently you can 
    use the <b>Open recent</b> command from the <b>File</b> menu. If the player 
    is not currently open you can drag and drop the file on to the Player icon 
    on the desktop. However if the Player is open, simply drag and drop the file 
    on to the player window. The file is loaded into the player and is then ready 
    for playing. You can open files which reside locally on your hard drive or 
    a local network using the <b>Open</b> command, you can also open files which 
    reside on the Internet at a remote location to do this use the <b>Open URL...</b> 
    command. The types of files which can be opened in the Player are those with 
    the extensions .smil, .smi and .grins simply you can choose how to view these 
    using the '<b>File of type:</b>' list options, to view all files in a directory 
    choose '<b>All files</b>'.</p>
  <p span class="Normal"><b>NOTE:</b> You should not double click a SMIL-2.0 document, 
    since the Ambulant SMIL-2.0 Player will not usually be the default SMIL player on your 
    system. </p>
  <p span class="Normal">When the Player is opened it is a default size. When 
    you open a document in the Player, the window size will change to that which 
    is specified in the actual document. Manual re-sizing of the Player window 
    is not recommended as this can cause problems during playback of the document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p span class="ProductHeader"><a name="use_set"></a>Setting Preferences</p>
  <p span class="Normal">Changing the Player <b>Preferences</b> allows you to 
    specify which options in a document are played. One of the main reasons for 
    changing these settings is to take advantage of documents which when created 
    use the SMIL <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SWITCH </font>content 
    control features. There is an 'element' in SMIL called the '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SWITCH</font>' 
    this is a powerful feature which enable authors of SMIL documents to create 
    documents with embedded features which personalize the presentation per user. 
    A few examples of these features are:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p span class="Normal">User X has set their preferences to <b>56k Modem</b> 
      and user Y has set theirs to <b>28.8k Modem</b>. In the document that they 
      will play the author has incorporated a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SWITCH</font> 
      for the player to make based on the <b>system bitrate</b>. If a user has 
      selected <b>56k Modem</b> or higher then they see higher quality images 
      but if the user has selected a rate of lower than <b>56k Modem</b> they 
      see lower quality images. Users X and Y are unaware of this selection feature 
      occurring as the Player when reading the document takes the preference settings 
      and notes which part of the document to play back in each case. In this 
      case the only difference is the quality of the images however the author 
      could have changed media type and perhaps played a video clip instead of 
      the higher quality images. The power of this content control feature will 
      become apparent when play back over the Internet capabilities are incorporated 
      into the Player, then true bandwidth considerations become into being.</p>
    <p span class="Normal">A similar selection to the one above can be made on 
      the basis of language. User X has Spanish selected and user Y has English 
      selected as their '<b>System language</b>' in the <b>Preferences</b> dialogue. 
      The document author has included two audio files one which has a voice over 
      in English and the other is Spanish. The Player will play the appropriate 
      audio file for each of the users this improves the quality of the presentation 
      which may include some vital details that only the audio helps to clarify. 
      This many also reach a wider multi-lingual audience without the added work 
      involved in creating two separate language presentation versions.</p>
    <p span class="Normal">A new feature of the SMIL <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SWITCH</font> 
      is audio descriptions. This allows the document authors to create audio 
      descriptions which can be used where additional visual information about 
      audio is required. Should the user have this option checked then they can 
      see this information as well as hear the actual audio too. Again demonstrating 
      that a wider audience can be reached using the same document.</p>
    <p span class="Normal"><b>NOTE:</b> The selection of content based on bandwidth 
      or language is only meaningful if the document author put alternative content 
      into the document.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="Normal">The Internet Browser control setting in the <b>Preferences</b> 
    dialogue allows the user to decide how they view HTML regions. If Internet 
    Explorer control is selected then a border is displayed on those regions the 
    default is to view the regions without this boundary.</p>
