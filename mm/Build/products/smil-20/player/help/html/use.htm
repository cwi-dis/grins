<p span class="ProductTitle">Using the Player</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p span class="ProductHeader"><a name="use_open"></a>Opening files</p>
  <p span class="Normal">Opening files for playing in the Player can be achieved 
    in a number of ways. You may use the commands <b>Open...</b> and Open URL... 
    from the File menu, or is you have opened the file recently you can use the 
    Open recent command from the File menu. If the player is not currently open 
    you can drag and drop the file onto the Player icon on the desktop. However 
    if the Player is open, simply drag and drop the file on to the player window. 
    The file is loaded into the player and is then ready for playing. You can 
    open files which reside locally on your hard drive or a local network using 
    the Open command, you can also open files which reside on the Internet at 
    a remote location to do this use the Open URL... command. The types of files 
    which can be opened in the Player are those with the extensions .smil, .smi 
    and .grins simply you can choose how to view these using the 'File of type:' 
    list options, to view all files in a directory choose 'All files'.</p>
  <p span class="Normal">When the Player is opened it is a default size when 
    you open a document in the Player the window size will change to that which 
    is specified in the actual document. Manual resizing of the Player window 
    is not recommended as this can cause problems during playback of the document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p span class="ProductHeader"><a name="use_set"></a>Setting Preferences</p>
  <p span class="Normal">Changing the Player Preferences is in effect where you 
    can personalise the Player to your requirements. There are a number of reasons 
    for setting the main one being the improved quality of playing documents back 
    over the Internet. Setting the bitrate or connection type that you have will 
    improve the performance of the document. Another reason for changing the settings 
    is to enable the Player to take advantage of features which have been incorporated 
    within the actual SMIL documents. There is an 'element' in SMIL called the 
    'SWITCH' this is a powerful feature which enable authors of SMIL documents 
    to create documents with hidden features which improve the presentation for 
    each user. These hidden features are diverse and by setting your preferences 
    correctly you can have access to these features as the default is to have 
    most of these turned off. A few examples of these features are:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p span class="Normal">User X has a 56k modem connection but user Y only has 
      28.8k connection and so they have set their preferences 'System bitrate:' 
      to reflect this. In the document that they play the author has set a selection 
      for the player to make based on the connection type. If a user has a connection 
      of 56k modem or higher then they see higher quality images but if the user 
      has a connection rate of lower than 56k modem then they see a lower quality 
      image. Users X and Y are unaware of this feature as the Player when reading 
      the document takes the preference settings and notes which part of the document 
      to play back in each case. The benefit to User Y is that they have an uninterrupted 
      presentation viewing experience as they have not had to spend time waiting 
      for the large higher quality images to be downloaded which would have meant 
      buffering time for them.</p>
    <p span class="Normal">A similar selection to the one above can be made on 
      the basis of language. User X has Spanish selected and User has English 
      selected as their 'System language' in the Preferences dialog. The document 
      author has included two audio files one which has a voice over in Englishand 
      the other is Spanish.Tthe Player will play the appropriate audio file for 
      each of the users this improves the quality of the presentation which may 
      include some vital details which only the audio helps to clarify.</p>
    <p span class="Normal">A new feature of the SMIL SWITCH is audio descriptions. 
      This allows the document authors to create audio descriptions which can 
      be used where additional information about audio is required. Should the 
      user have this option checked then they can see this information as well 
      as hear the actual audio too.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="Normal">The Internet Broswer control setting in the Preferences dialog 
    allows the user to decide how they view html regions. If Internet Explorer 
    control is selected then a border is displayed on those regions the default 
    is to view the regions without this boundary.</p>

  <p span class="ProductHeader"><a name="use_tools"></a>Player
