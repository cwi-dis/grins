=======================

platforms.

System Requirements
-------------------

This release of GRiNS is supported under Windows-98SE, Windows-2000
and Windows-XP. This version of GRiNS will work under Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4, but since these operating systems do not support
multiple audio channels or other multimedia extensions, you may
experience problems.

This version integrated enhanced support for Windows-XP, although not
all Windows-XP issues may be addressed in this release.

General Information
-------------------
Please see the Oratrix website, http://www.oratrix.com for more
information on the GRiNS Player for SMIL 2.0 and other SMIL-related
products.

This player will playback RealMedia items in your SMIL document during
editing. Because of licensing limitations of the RealOne player, we
are not able to include the various RealOne components in this
distribution.  As a result, you must have installed the RealOne player
on your system prior to previewing RealOne's RealMedia datatypes.
To obtain a recent release of the RealNetworks RealOne player, see 
   http://www.real.com/player
for details.

This player will also have full support for QuickTime media items in
your presentation if you have also installed QuickTime. Again, because
of licensing restrictions, we may not redistribute QuickTime with this
release. As a consquence, please download and install the QuickTime
player prior to accessing QuickTime content in a SMIL file.
