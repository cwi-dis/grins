	where one of the elements before the target element had

    <ul>
	<li>There were occasional crashes for documents using the regionName
	  attributes. Fixed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 29</h2>

      <li>Support for synchronization to begin/end/activateEvent on
	area and anchor element.</li>
      <li>Added playback support for Windows Media Video and Audio

      <li>A number of problems were fixed having to do with multiple
	layout elements inside a switch inside the head section.</li>
      <li>URLs referencing source materials can now have queries in
	them (<i>i.e.</i>, URLs of the form
	src="image.gif?bitrate=500") which will be ignored when
	playing back from the local disk.  This makes the player more
	compatible with the RealPlayer which uses these queries to
	encode extra information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 27</h2>

    <p>
      Some users have reported a problem with the speed with which the
      application responds to mouse events when a video is playing.
      The application does respond, but it may take up to several
      seconds before it does.  Often restarting the application
      helps.  We are investigating the problem and will try to come up
      with a solution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>RealVideo, RealText, and RealPix media elements now obey the
	z-index and fit attributes properly.</li>
      <li>More fixes to the scheduler.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 24</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The actuate="onLoad" attribute value for anchors is now
	implemented.</li>
      <li>When linking to a document that GRiNS cannot handle itself
	(<i>i.e.</i> all documents except SMIL documents), the document
	is handed off to the appropriate application.</li>
      <li>RealVideo, RealText, and RealPix media elements can now be
	used as the source of hyperlinks.</li>
      <li>Various improvements in the scheduler.
	In particular, an excl node with no resolved children and no
	explicit duration will now not play.  Also, a node with 0
	duration but with a min attribute greater than 0 will play and
	end after the min time is up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 23</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Improvements to the hyperlinking code.</li>
      <li>Support for embedded HTML documents (<i>i.e.</i>, you can
	use HTML documents as media objects).</li>
      <li>The readIndex attribute is now recognized.</li>
    </ul>
