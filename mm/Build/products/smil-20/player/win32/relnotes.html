    <h1>GRiNS Player beta for SMIL 2.0, Release Notes
      for Windows</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS Player beta for SMIL 2.0,
      Release Notes for Windows, build 36, November 23, 2000. A more
      recent version of these release notes, as well as more recent
      builds of the player, may be available through <a
      href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/SMIL-2.0/">
	http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/SMIL-2.0/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this is an early beta, and the playback engine has not 
      been tested very thoroughly with large documents. You may
      experience instabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> There has been a problem with hanging
      processes with Build 35 and some older versions of the Player on
      Windows.  This problem was fixed in Build 36.  Before
      uninstalling older versions of the Player, and before installing
      the Player on top of an older version, be sure to kill any
      processes with the name GRiNSP_SV2.exe (use the Task Manager to
      kill these processes).
    </p>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 35</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The problem that the Player process didn't actually go away
	on exit was solved.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Changes Since Build 33</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All attributes that are valid according to the current SMIL
	2.0 Language Profile are now recognized, although not all
	attributes are implemented.</li>
      <li>The SMIL 2.0 default namespace is now
	http://www.w3.org/2000/SMIL20/CR/Language older namespaces are
	recognized but result in a warning message.</li>
      <li>The fill="hold" attribute value has been implemented.</li>
      <li>The fill="transition" attribute value has been implemented.</li>
      <li>A problem was fixed when the presentation was paused while
	there were children in an excl elements that were paused due to
	excl/priorityClass semantics.</li>
      <li>A problem was fixed with container elements that need to be
	frozen from the start.</li>
      <li>A problem was fixed when jumping to an element in a sequence
	where one of the elements before the target element had
	indefinite duration.</li>
      <li>A problem was fixed with playing a video element in a region
	that didn't fit in it's parent region (and was therefore clipped
	to the size of the parent region).</li>
      <li>A problem was fixed in the Preferences dialog.  The check
	marks for the systemOverdubOrSubtitle and systemCaptions
	attributes were exchanged.</li>
      <li>The override="uid-only" attribute value on customTest
	elements has been implemented.</li>
      <li>The param element is now recognized.</li>
      <li>The syntax for multiple values in the systemRequired and
	customTest attributes has been implemented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 32</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>There were occasional crashes for documents using the regionName
	  attributes. Fixed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 29</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for viewportOpenEvent and viewportCloseEvent.</li>
      <li>Support for synchronization to begin/end/activateEvent on
	area and anchor element.</li>
      <li>Added playback support for Windows Media Video and Audio
	files.</li>
      <li>Various fixes to the scheduler.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 28</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>All known problems with rendering RealVideo, RealText, and
	RealPix have been fixed.</li>
      <li>The delay in responding to mouse events has been fixed.</li>
      <li>A number of problems were fixed having to do with multiple
	layout elements inside a switch inside the head section.</li>
      <li>URLs referencing source materials can now have queries in
	them (<i>i.e.</i>, URLs of the form
	src="image.gif?bitrate=500") which will be ignored when
	playing back from the local disk.  This makes the player more
	compatible with the RealPlayer which uses these queries to
	encode extra information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 27</h2>

    <p>
      Some users have reported a problem with the speed with which the
      application responds to mouse events when a video is playing.
      The application does respond, but it may take up to several
      seconds before it does.  Often restarting the application
      helps.  We are investigating the problem and will try to come up
      with a solution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>RealVideo, RealText, and RealPix media elements now obey the
	z-index and fit attributes properly.</li>
      <li>More fixes to the scheduler.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 24</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The actuate="onLoad" attribute value for anchors is now
	implemented.</li>
      <li>When linking to a document that GRiNS cannot handle itself
	(<i>i.e.</i> all documents except SMIL documents), the document
	is handed off to the appropriate application.</li>
      <li>RealVideo, RealText, and RealPix media elements can now be
	used as the source of hyperlinks.</li>
      <li>Various improvements in the scheduler.
	In particular, an excl node with no resolved children and no
	explicit duration will now not play.  Also, a node with 0
	duration but with a min attribute greater than 0 will play and
	end after the min time is up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes Since Build 23</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Improvements to the hyperlinking code.</li>
      <li>Support for embedded HTML documents (<i>i.e.</i>, you can
	use HTML documents as media objects).</li>
      <li>The readIndex attribute is now recognized.</li>
    </ul>
