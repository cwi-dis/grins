GRiNS Editor Pro 2.0.1 Readme
=========================

GRiNS Editor Pro 2.0.1 is a SMIL 2.0 player for the Macintosh and
Windows platforms.

System Requirements
-------------------

GRiNS requires at least Windows 98 or Windows 2000. GRiNS will work on
Windows 95 and Windows NT 4, but these operating systems do not
support multiple audio channels so you may experience problems.
GRiNS has not yet been extensively tested on Windows XP, but the first
experiments indicate that GRiNS works properly on XP.


General Information
-------------------

Please see the Oratrix website, http://www.oratrix.com for more
information on the GRiNS editor and player. 

This player will playback RealMedia items in your SMIL 2.0 presentation
if you have also installer RealPlayer on your system.  You do not need
RealONE for this since RealPlayer is only used as a plugin to play
back RealMedia items.

In order to enable this feature you need RealPlayer G2 or later,
either in the Basic or Plus version. See the RealNetworks website
www.real.com for details.
