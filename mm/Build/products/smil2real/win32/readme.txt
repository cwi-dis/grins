for SMIL 2.0 that provides targeted support for the RealNetworks
RealOne player.

System Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release of GRiNS is supported under Windows-98SE, Windows-2000
and Windows-XP. This version of GRiNS will work under Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4, but since these operating systems do not support
multiple audio channels or other multimedia extensions, you may
experience problems.

This version integrated enhanced support for Windows-XP, although not
all Windows-XP issues may be addressed in this release.


General Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the Oratrix website, http://www.oratrix.com for more
information on the GRiNS Editor for RealOne.

This Editor will playback RealMedia items in your GRiNS document
during editing. Because of licensing limitations of the RealOne
player, we are not able to include the various RealOne components in
this distribution.  As a result, you must have installed the RealOne
player on your system prior to previewing RealOne's RealMedia
datatypes.
