    <h2>
      Changes since 2.0 release
    </h2>
    Numerous bugs have been fixed and features have been added. Here are the highlights:
    
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Support for targetting the RealOne media browser and related info/context panes has
	    been added, and anchor and link editing in general has improved.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Editing begin and end times of media items now conforms more to what people
	    are used to from video editors and such. Visual feedback indicates when
	    the current time coincides with another media item begin or end, and a
	    mark command has been added to allow you to interactively remember "interesting"
	    times while playing back a sound or video file.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Animation editing has improved and conforms more to users' expectations
	    based on using other software with similar functionality.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The event editor has been rationalized, enhanced and made more robust.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The bandwidth usage feedback now conforms more to reality, and offers
	    an automatic fix for some common problems.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Synchronous playback is now an option. It makes the preview player behave more
	    like the RealOne player, so fine-tuning media synchronization is easier. As the
	    performance penalty of this is rather large it is mainly useful if you have a fast
	    machine.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The documentation has been greatly enhanced and updated: a reference manual
	    has been added, the introductory manuals (QuickStart Guide, Tutorial Guide)
	    have been rationalized and "How To" documents were added. The collection of How To
	    documents is expected to grow over time, check the Oratrix website.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Many aspects of the user interface have been improved: dialog layout, help
	    strings, command structure, source view color coding, keyboard shortcuts, etc.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Memory usage has been optimized. Memory-related crashes, especially on Windows 98,
	    have been fixed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Compatibility with Windows XP has been improved.
	  </li>
	</ul>
