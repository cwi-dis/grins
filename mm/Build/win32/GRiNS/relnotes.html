    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Player for Windows Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS player for
      Windows 95/98/NT4, Release 0.2, patchlevel 1. More
      information on GR<i>i</i>NS can be obtained at <A
	HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS">http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS</A>, or 
      by email to <A
	HREF="mailto:grins-request@cwi.nl">grins-request@cwi.nl</A>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What (sparse) documentation on GR<i>i</i>NS is available at this 
      time can also be found on the homepage.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      For decent performance you probably need at least a 100Mhz
      Pentium with 16Mb, but 32Mb is definitely preferred. You need
      about 15Mb of free diskspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need Python 1.5 with PythonWin and preferrably Microsoft
      Internet Explorer 3.02 or later (see <A HREF="#ie">below</A> for
      details) . All of these are included in the distribution, see
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some older versions of Windows 95, and possibly NT too, you
      may need a COM patch and/or an Active Movie patch. See the <A
	HREF="#problems">problems</A> section below for the symptoms
      and the solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation instructions</h3>
    <p>
      The order in which you should install things is to first install
      Python and Internet Explorer (if needed) and only then the
      GR<i>i</i>NS player. You can skip either of the first steps if
      you already have that package installed, but <b>do</b> note that
      GR<i>i</i>NS needs exactly version 1.5 of Python, and a specific
      build number at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have already installed Python it may be prudent not 
      to install this version of GR<i>i</i>NS but wait for a
      self-contained version, which should be available in August.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to use the GR<i>i</i>NS player without installing 
      Internet Explorer, see the section on <A HREF="#ie">Internet
	Explorer dependency</A> below.
    <p>
      Install everything in the following order:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Python 1.5 and PythonWin (the order is important):

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Run <code>python15.exe</code> to install the Python 1.5 core.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Run <code>win32-104.exe</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Run <code>win32com-103.exe</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Run <code>pywin-107.exe</code>. These last three steps install the
	    PythonWin extensions.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>
	To install Internet Explorer run <code>msie302r.exe</code>.
      </li>

      <li>
	Install the GR<i>i</i>NS player by running
	<code>grins.exe</code>. 
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once the installation is complete, you may run the viewer using
      the start menu, the desktop shortcut or by double-clicking a
      <code>.smi</code> or <code>.smil</code> file.
    </p>

    <h3>Issues resolved</h3>

    <p>
      The following issues have been fixed since the previous release:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The "open file" dialog works again. </li>
      <li>
        The .smi/.smil filetype issues have been solved. </li>
    </ul>
        
    
    <h3>Customization</h3>
    <p>
      One aspect of GR<i>i</i>NS can be customized: the handling of
      the test attributes such as bitrates and language (see section
      4.4 of the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/">SMIL
	specification</a>). See the <A
	HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/examples.html">examples
	section</A> on the homepage for details.

    </p>

    <h3>The SMIL language</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the complete
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/">SMIL 1.0</a>
      definition except where noted <a href="#unsup">below</a>.  A
      conforming SMIL document can be correctly parsed, but a few
      features are not implemented.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform dependencies in media handling</h3>
    <p>
      There are some differences between the various platforms.  See
      the <a
	href="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/relnotes/supported.html">chart
	of supported media types</a> on the GR<i>i</i>NS website
      for the supported media types on the various supported
      platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Access methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the following access methods
      (URL schemes).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported
      by the GR<i>i</i>NS player.  Documents that make use of these
      features are parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform-specific issues</h3>
    <p>
      There are also a number of features that are not supported on
      all platforms, or not supported identically. The following
      problems are known for the player on Windows:
    </p>

    <p>
      As issues are reported they are added to the <A
      HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/relnotes.html">release notes</A>
      and <A HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/GRiNS/issues.txt">open issues</a>
      sections on the home page.
    </p>

    <h3><A NAME="problems">Compatability problems</A></h3>
    <p>
    If you are running Windows 95 or NT 3.51 and do not have a recent
release of Internet Explorer, you may encounter the following error
when starting Pythonwin:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
	import win32api [or some other win32 module]
	ImportError: DLL load failed: One of the library files needed to run this application 
	cannot be found.
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      In that case run <code>oadist.exe</code> to update COM.
    </p>

    <h3>Sound and video problems</h3>
    <p>
      If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine
      (e.g. <code>*.aiff</code> or <code>*.mpeg</code>) try installing
      Active Movie by running <code>amovie.exe</code>. For
      details see <code>grins-mci.txt</code>.
    </p>

    <h3><A NAME="ie">Internet Explorer dependency</A></h3>

    <p>
      MS Internet explorer is needed in order to use MSIE
      functionality in html pages or just components using the HTML
      channel. If you do not want to depend on MSIE, follow the
      following steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the PyDLLs directory you will find the file
      <code>Htmlex.pyd</code>, <code>HtmlexMS.pyd</code> and
      <code>HtmlexW.pyd</code>.  The two first are the same. The
      working file is always <code>Htmlex.pyd</code>.  If you want to
      use the Webster HTML Control, which is totally independent from
      MSIE, the file you need is <code>HtmlexW.pyd</code>. You just
      need to rename it to Htmlex.pyd and get rid of the old file. By
      that moment the working pyd file will be the Webster version and
      not MSIE version. The MSIE version will be at
      <code>HtmlexMS.pyd</code>. If you want to switch back to MSIE
      control you should follow the same steps, keeping a copy of
      <code>Htmlex.pyd</code> (W) renaming it to
      <code>HtmlexW.pyd</code> and renaming <code>HtmlexMS.pyd</code>
      to <code>Htmlex.pyd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next version the choice of the HTML control will be made
      through the setup process. But since it was a change at the last
      moment, we thought we should release this version, even if it is
      not done automatically through the setup process.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suggest the following: If you have MSIE installed, use the
      default (MS) version. If you have no MS installed, use the
      "Webster version", although it lacks high-level functionality
      such as Java. The choice is yours.
