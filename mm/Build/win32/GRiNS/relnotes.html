    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Player for Windows Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS player for
      Windows 95/98/NT4, Release 0.5, patchlevel 0. More information on
      GR<i>i</i>NS can be obtained at <A
      HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS</A>,
      or by email to <A
      HREF="mailto:grins-request@oratrix.com">grins-request@oratrix.com</A>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What (sparse) documentation on GR<i>i</i>NS is available at this 
      time can also be found on the homepage.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      For decent performance you probably need at least a 100Mhz
      Pentium with 16Mb, but 32Mb is definitely preferred (as is a
      faster processor). You need about 10Mb of free diskspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some older versions of Windows 95, and possibly NT too, you
      may need a COM patch and/or an Active Movie patch. See the <A
	HREF="#problems">problems</A> section below for the symptoms
      and the solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform dependencies in media handling</h3>
    <p>
      There are some differences between the various platforms.  See
      the <a
	href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/relnotes/supported.html">chart
	of supported media types</a> on the GR<i>i</i>NS website
      for the supported media types on the various supported
      platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Access methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the following access methods
      (URL schemes).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported
      by the GR<i>i</i>NS player.  Documents that make use of these
      features are parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform-specific issues</h3>
    <p>
      There are also a number of features that are not supported on
      all platforms, or not supported identically. The following
      problems are known for the player on Windows:
    </p>

    <p>
      As issues are reported they are added to the <A
      HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/relnotes.html">release
      notes</A> and <A
      HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/issues.txt">open issues</a>
      sections on the home page.
    </p>

    <h3><A NAME="problems">HTML problems</A></h3>
    <p>
      GRiNS can render HTML either through the Webster HTML Control,
      which is built-in, or through the Internet Explorer HTML
      Control, which is part of IE4. If you have problems rendering
      HTML try changing the control, in the preferences dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features 
      but always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is 
      a HTML 3 control only, and has problems with some things like
      using tags in URLs and accessing files via network neighborhood
      naming.  Both controls can be slow rendering the data on the
      screen.
    </p>

    <h3>Sound and video problems</h3>
    <p>
      If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine
      (e.g. <code>*.aiff</code> or <code>*.mpeg</code>) try installing
      Active Movie, also sometimes known as Media Player. It is
      included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and for Windows 95 you should
      see <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/mediaplayer/default.asp">Microsoft's
      Media Player download page</a> for details.
