1. Open 'cmif extensions.dsw' in \cmif\win32\src
(no other project needs to be opened)

2 Assert that 
   python\Include
   python\PC
   python\Extensions\win32\src
are in your include files directories 
(set them using tools|options|directories + combo choice:Include files)

and that 
 	python\PCBuild
	python\Extensions\win32\Build
	cmif\win32\ACCUSOFT\Gear
are in your library files
(set them using tools|options|directories + combo choice:Library files)

Note: there are other ways to have the same effect.

3. Check that the absolute directories for GRiNSRes project
Project Setting|Custom Build (tab)
are the correct for your configuratio. 
(the absolute folders shouldn't be there but they are)
  
3. Build all
set active configuration to: 'All cmif extensions-Win32 Release'
and then select Rebuild All

4. To test, transfer to cmif/bin (the testing folder)
	Python15.dll
	Python.exe
	PyWinTypes15.dll
	Pythonwin.exe
	win32ui.pyd
and also the Accusoft dll: Gear32sd.dll

Transfer also to cmif/bin/DLLs
	win32api.pyd
	win32trace.pyd
Run Pythonwin.exe 
and the application: Pythonwin /run iGRiNS.py
(check absolute folders in iGRiNS.py before running the app,
the absolute folders shouldn't be there but they are)

5. Freeze (read also the readme.txt in cmif\Build\win32\Editor)
a) Set the absolute folders in cmif\Build\win32\Editor\domkp.bat
and \cmif\Build\win32\GRiNS\domkp.bat to agree with your configuration
(usually only the drive letter)
b) Run the bat files 
c) Build GRiNSed and GRiNS projects (use Set Active Configuratio)
d) To test them transfer in an emty folder:


Thats all.
