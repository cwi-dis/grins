GRiNS Editor for Windows Release Notes

This is the readme file for the GRiNS editor and player for Windows
95/98/NT4, Release 1.0beta. More information on GRiNS can be
obtained at http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS, or by email to
grins-request@oratrix.com.  Release notes for this version can be
found in the file relnotes.html in the top-level directory.  More
documentation can be found on the homepage.

Prerequisites

For decent performance you probably need at least a 100Mhz Pentium
with 32Mb, but more memory and a faster processor are definitely
preferred. You need about 10Mb of free diskspace.

For some older versions of Windows 95, and possibly NT too, you
may need a COM patch and/or an Active Movie patch. See the
problems section below for the symptoms
and the solution.

Feedback

Bug reports and other technical feedback should be sent to
grins-support@oratrix.com, please check the feedback section on the
homepage for details.

Non-technical feedback should be sent to info@oratrix.com.

Example documents

A number of example documents can be found in the Examples
directory. More examples will be added to the GRiNS home page over
time.

License keys

To start the editor you need a license key. You may have been provided
with a temporary license key in the same message in which you received
the password for the download area. If not you can send an empty mail
message to evaluation-license@oratrix.com and we will send you a
time-limited key, or we will mail you details on how to proceed.

Windows user interface open issues

GRiNS can render HTML either through the Internet Explorer HTML
control (part of IE4) or the built-in WebsterPro HTML control.  This
is user-selectable throught the Preferences dialog.  In some
circumstances the IE control causes the player/editor to crash.  If
this happens, use the WebsterPro control.

Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features but
always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is a HTML 3
control only, and has problems with some things like using tags in
URLs and accessing files via network neighborhood naming.  Both
controls can be slow rendering the data on the screen.

If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine
(e.g. *.aiff or *.mpeg) try installing Active Movie, also sometimes
known as Media Player. It is included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and
for Windows 95 you should see Microsoft's Media Player download page
for details.
