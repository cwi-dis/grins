GR<i>i</i>NS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5.1 Release Notes for Windows</h1>
These are the release notes for GR<i>i</i>NS for RealSystem G2, version
1.5.1 for Windows. This file contains release notes for both the Lite and
the Pro versions. For a more up-to-date edition of these notes, see <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">http://www.oratrix.com/GR<i>i</i>NS</a>.
<h3>
Open Issues</h3>
Using the <i>Edit Content</i> command from the <i>Edit</i> menu starts
the program registered for that file type. This may not always be an Editor.
<p>There are some differences in execution between the preview player and
the RealPlayer G2 when looping images and text.
<p>Text nodes are translated to RealText files when publishing the document.
If such a text node does not have an explicit duration set, the RealText
file will not have one either. No duration in a RealText file means that
it will have an default duration of one minute, which is probably not what
was intended. It is better to always add a duration to text nodes.
<p>If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in the
bottom right corner of the preview player to indicate that not all text
is shown.
<p>The SMIL standard does not permit a jump (hyperlink) into a switch node.
GR<i>i</i>NS currently does not prevent the user from creating such hyperlinks
and also does not warn about them. The RealPlayer G2 does not follow such
links.
<p>Windows NT does not allow playback of two separate audio channels simultaneously.
Windows 98 does not have this problem.
<p>When the height and width in a RealText file differ from the height
and width of the region it is played in, the behavior of the preview player
in GR<i>i</i>NS and the RealPlayer G2 differ. It is best to make sure that
the height and width in both locations are the same.
<p>There may be problems with certain types of TIFF files when they are
converted to JPEG files during publishing. The problems only occur with
TIFF files that use CMYK colors.
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS can crash when invalid values are entered for the Clip
begin or Clip end properties in video nodes. Make sure that the values
are valid (or empty) before trying to play back a document using Clip begin
or Clip end.
<p>Partial anchors on video nodes can be created and are saved correctly,
but during playback in GR<i>i</i>NS, the whole video region is sensitive
instead of just the anchor area.
<h3>
Changes since Version 1.5</h3>
The GR<i>i</i>NS Tutorials are now included in the GR<i>i</i>NS installer.
<p>GR<i>i</i>NS now checks whether a .grins file was created with a compatible
version and gives the option of going ahead or cancelling.
<p>Start and end times on anchors are now obeyed during playback.
<p>The background color of a RealPix Caption Region is now properly saved.
<p>The problem of pausing and stopping audio halfway through playback which
didn't actually stop the audio has now been fixed.
<p>The latest version of RealNetworks RealProducer library is now used
to convert media objects to RealMedia types.
<p>The crash that occurred when the top-most element has a begin delay
has now been fixed.
<p>It is now possible to create hyperlinks to external documents from all
media items (Pro version only).
<p>The start and end times of anchors are now correctly read in when opening
a SMIL file.
<p>Anchors with no link attached are now no longer active (i.e. clickable)
during playback (Pro version only).
<p>The scale attribute on channels is now a pop-up list with the possible
values.
<p>Timed anchors are now specified using the start time and the duration,
instead of start and end times.
