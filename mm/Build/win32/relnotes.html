    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Editor for SMIL Release 1.0 Release Notes for Windows</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GRiNS Editor and Player for
      SMIL Release 1.0 for Windows.  These release notes were last
      updated on August 26 1999.  For a more up-to-date version of
      these notes, look

    </p>

    <h3>Windows User Interface Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
      GR<i>i</i>NS can render HTML either through the Internet
      Explorer HTML control (part of IE4) or the built-in WebsterPro
      HTML control.  This is user-selectable throught the Preferences
      dialog.  In some circumstances the IE control causes the
      player/editor to crash.  If this happens, use the WebsterPro
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features 
      but always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is 
      a HTML 3 control only, and has problems with some things like
      using tags in URLs and accessing files via network neighborhood
      naming.  Both controls can be slow rendering the data on the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine
      (e.g. <code>*.aiff</code> or <code>*.mpeg</code>) try installing
      Active Movie, also sometimes known as Media Player. It is
      included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and for Windows 95 you should
      see <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/mediaplayer/default.asp">Microsoft's
      Media Player download page</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Windows that were hidden behind other windows may pop up at
      seemingly random moments.  Move your windows so that they don't
      fully overlap.  In that way you can easily get back to the
      window you were working with.
    </p>

    <h3>Access Methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS Editor and Player for SMIL supports the
      following access methods (URL schemes):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is possible to create and edit documents that make use of
      other access methods (in particular the rtsp access method), but
      they cannot be previewed.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL Features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported by the
      GR<i>i</i>NS Editor and Player for SMIL.  Documents that make
      use of these features are parsed correctly, but the features are
      ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>
