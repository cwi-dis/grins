    <h1>GR<i>i</i>NS Editor for Windows Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      These are the release notes for the GR<i>i</i>NS editor and player for
      Windows 95/98/NT4, Release 0.5, patchlevel 6. More information on
      GR<i>i</i>NS can be obtained at
      <A HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">http://www.oratrix.com/GR<i>i</i>NS</A>,
      or by email to
      <A HREF="mailto:grins-request@oratrix.com">grins-request@oratrix.com</A>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What (sparse) documentation on GR<i>i</i>NS is available at this 
      time can also be found on the homepage.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      For decent performance you probably need at least a 100Mhz
      Pentium with 32Mb, but more memory and a faster processor are
      definitely preferred. You need about 10Mb of free diskspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some older versions of Windows 95, and possibly NT too, you
      may need a COM patch and/or an Active Movie patch. See the
      <A HREF="#problems">problems</A> section below for the symptoms
      and the solution.
    </p>


    <h3>Installation instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Just execute the installer and follow the directions of the wizard.
    </p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Bug reports and other technical feedback should be sent to
      <A HREF="mailto:grins-support@oratrix.com">grins-support@oratrix.com</A>,
      please check the
      <A HREF="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/feedback.html">feedback section</A>
      on the homepage for details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Non-technical feedback should be sent to
      <A HREF="mailto:info@oratrix.com">info@oratrix.com</A>.
    </p>

    <h3>Example documents</h3>
    <p>
      A number of example documents can be found in the Examples
      directory. More examples will be added to the
      <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS">GRiNS home page</a> over
      time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>License keys</h3>
    <p>
      To start the editor you need a license key. You may have been
      provided with a temporary license key in the same message in
      which you received the password for the download area. If not
      you can send an empty mail message to
      <a href="mailto:evalutation-license@oratrix.com">evalutation-license@oratrix.com</a>
      and we will send you a time-limited key, or we will mail you
      details on how to proceed.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform dependencies in media handling</h3>
    <p>
      There are some differences between the various platforms.  See
      the
      <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/Software/GS-supported1.html">chart
	of supported media types</a> on the GR<i>i</i>NS website
      for the supported media types on the various supported
      platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Access methods</h3>
    <p>
      The GR<i>i</i>NS player supports the following access methods
      (URL schemes).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>file</li>
      <li>http</li>
      <li>ftp</li>
      <li>data</li>
      <li>gopher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="unsup">Unsupported SMIL features</a></h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few SMIL features that are not supported
      by the GR<i>i</i>NS player.  Documents that make use of these
      features are parsed correctly, but the features are ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> attributes in the
	<code>anchor</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fit="fill"</code> and <code>fit="scroll"</code>
	attribute values in <code>region</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>name="pics-label"</code> attribute value in
	<code>meta</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>alt</code> attribute in media object elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>fill</code> attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Windows user interface open issues</h3>
    <p>
      GR<i>i</i>NS can render HTML either through the Internet
      Explorer HTML control (part of IE4) or the built-in WebsterPro
      HTML control.  This is user-selectable throught the Preferences
      dialog.  In some circumstances the IE control causes the
      player/editor to crash.  If this happens, use the WebsterPro
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each control has its good and bad points. IE4 has more features 
      but always shows scrollbars which is not very pretty. Webster is 
      a HTML 3 control only, and has problems with some things like
      using tags in URLs and accessing files via network neighborhood
      naming.  Both controls can be slow rendering the data on the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If sounds or videos are not played correctly on your machine
      (e.g. <code>*.aiff</code> or <code>*.mpeg</code>) try installing
      Active Movie, also sometimes known as Media Player. It is
      included in Service Pack 4 for NT, and for Windows 95 you should
      see <a
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/mediaplayer/default.asp">Microsoft's
      Media Player download page</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform-specific issues</h3>
    <p>
      There are also a number of features that are not supported on
      all platforms, or not supported identically.
    </p>

    <p>
      As issues are reported they are added to the release notes and
      open issues sections on the
      <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">GR<i>i</i>NS home page</a>.
