    <h1>GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5 Release Notes for Windows</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5
      for Windows.  This file contains release notes for both the Lite and the
      Pro versions.
      
      For a more up-to-date edition of
      these notes, see <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS</a>.

    <h3>Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Using the <em>Edit Content</em> command from the <em>Edit</em>
      menu starts the program registered for that file type.  This may
      not always be an Editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it is possible to create timed anchors (Pro version
      only), the preview player does not honor them.  The RealPlayer
      G2, however, does.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some differences in execution between the preview
      player and the RealPlayer G2 when looping images and text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Text nodes are translated to RealText files when publishing the
      document.  If such a text node does not have an explicit
      duration set, the RealText file will not have one either.  No
      duration in a RealText file means that it will have an default
      duration of one minute, which is probably not what was intended.
      It is better to always add a duration to text nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in
      the bottom right corner of the preview player to indicate that
      not all text is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMIL standard does not permit a jump (hyperlink) into a
      switch node.  GRiNS currently does not prevent the user from
      creating such hyperlinks and also does not warn about them.  The
      RealPlayer G2 does not follow such links.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows NT does not allow playback of two separate audio
      channels simultaneously.  Windows 98 does not have this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the height and width in a RealText file differ from the
      height and width of the region it is played in, the behavior of
      the preview player in GRiNS and the RealPlayer G2 differ.  It is
      best to make sure that the height and width in both locations
      are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be problems with certain types of TIFF files when they 
      are converted to JPEG files during publishing.  The problems
      only occur with TIFF files that use CMYK colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRiNS can crash when invalid values are entered for the Clip
      begin or Clip end properties in video nodes.  Make sure that the
      values are valid (or empty) before trying to play back a
      document using Clip begin or Clip end.
