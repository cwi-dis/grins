    <h1>GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5 Release Notes for Windows</h1>

    <p>
      These are the release notes for GRiNS for RealSystem G2, version 1.5
      for Windows.  This file contains release notes for both the Lite and the
      Pro version.

      these notes, see <a href="http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS/">http://www.oratrix.com/GRiNS</a>.

    <h3>Open Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Using the <em>Edit Content</em> command starts the program
      registered for that file type.  This may not always be an editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it is possible to create timed anchors (Pro version
      only), the preview player does not honor them.  The RealPlayer
      G2, however, does.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some differences in execution between the preview
      player and the RealPlayer G2 when repeats are involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Text nodes get translated to RealText files when publishing the
      document.  If such a text node does not have an explicit
      duration set, the RealText file will not have one either.  No
      duration in a RealText file means that it will have an implicit
      duration of one minute, which is probably not what was intended.
      It is better to always add an explicit duration to text nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If text does not fit in its region, a small red box is shown in
      the bottom right corner of the preview player to indicate that
      not all text is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In SMIL it is not allowed to jump (hyperlink) into a switch
      node.  GRiNS currently does not prevent the user from creating
      such hyperlinks and also does not warn about them.  The
      RealPlayer G2 refuses to follow such links.
