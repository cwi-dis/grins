      When the view is launched the user must select <i>File</i>-><i>Open</i>to view
      the file to played. The file can be double clicked to open the
      player automatically.<P>

      The user can browse to the file they want to view, or type in a URL for
      a local or remote file directly.<P>

      A player window will open to the correct size to play the
      document.<P>

      <IMG SRC="player-active.gif" ALT="[Image of an active player
	window]"><P>

      The buttons allow the user to play, pause or stop the document.<P>

    <h3>Menu commands</h3>
	
		<img src="menu-file.gif" alt="File menu"><P>
	
	    <i>Open</I> opens an existing document. The already opened
	    session of the player will not be closed, this allows more
	    than one document can be played at the same time.<p>

	    <i>Close Window</i> closes the current window. Note that this does
	    not necessarily close the document, which may continue playing without
	    windows (audio will continue, for instance).<P>
	    
	    <i>Close Document</i> stops playing the document and closes it. <p>

	    <i>Preferences</i> - select the internet preferences for the
	    system. Here you can set your internet connection speed, preferred
	    language and such. This may cause alternative content to be played
	    in some documents.<p>
	 
		<i>Debug</i> is primarily for developers, but occasionally the information
		presented when you select the <i>Show Debug Window</i> may be helpful
		to track down problems in your documents. <p>

		<i>Quit</i> quits the editor. <p>
		
	    The <b>Edit</b> menu contains the standard edit commands. They are functional
	    in dialog windows only<p>
	    
	    <img src="menu-play.gif" alt="Play menu"><p>
	    
	    The commands here duplicate the <i>Play</i>, <i>Pause</i> and <i>Stop</i>
	    buttons in the document window. There is an extra keyboard shortcut, spacebar,
	    which does <i>Play</i> when stopped and toggles between <i>Play</i> and <i>Pause</i>
	    otherwise. <p>
	    
		<img src="menu-views.gif" alt="Views menu"><p>
		
		<i>Open Documents</i> allows you to select any of the open documents, which
		is then popped to the front. Menu commands now act on this document. <p>
		
		<i>Open Windows</i> is similar, but lists all windows (also source and
		dialog windows). <p>
		
		<i>Channel Visibility</i> allows you to selectively disable and enable channels,
		also known as SMIL regions. <p>
		
		<i>View Source</i> will open a window with the SMIL source for the current document. <p>
		
		<i>View Help Window</i> will open this help browser. <p>
