  	<H1>What is GRiNS</H1>
  	
      GRiNS supports the development of hypermedia applications that
      are to be rendered in a &quot;wide&quot; variety of environments
      from a single document source.<P>

      By using a declarative approach, we want to lower the
      accessibility threshold for authors AND provide for maximum
      portability and reuse of created documents (or document
      fragments).<P>

      The use of a declarative format externalises a document's
      behaviour, allowing presentation adaptability under varying
      presentation resource constraints. (This allows a document's
      content to be scaled up or down, depending on the viewer's
      facilities and/or their ability/desire to pay for access to
      higher quality information.)<P>

      While programming-based approaches may offer some performance
      advantages in the short run, the GRiNS approach provides wider
      access to quality information with less author effort than other
      systems.<P>

       Such presentations can be created with images, text, video and
      other spatial media occupying space on the screen in set
      locations. Video and multi-channel audio can also be set in
      time.<P>

      Databases may be accessed through an ODBC interface so that
      their contents can be integrated into multimedia documents.</P>

      Hyperlinks may be created between areas of the media occupying
      space or from text strings to other assets (represented as
      nodes).<P>

      Assets can include WWW URL's whose contents are seamlesly
      presented without the use of external browsers, and therefore
      without the provision of functionality for users to leave the
      authors application.</P>

      The integration of assets will include the ability to state
      alternative assets for presentation conditional on the
      distribution and presentation environments (such as the graphic
      capabilities of the presentation workstation, or the network
      performance, or Quality of Service) - this is not available in
      other tools.<P>

       The integration of media assets permits a clear statement of the
      temporal coordination of the assets.<P>

      The integrated multimedia document is delivered with the set of
      assets, each of which is in its original form able to be re-used
      by the user for other purposes - this may alter with some
      security features to control re-use. The separate structure of a
      presentation may also be reused independently of the
      content.<P>

      The output of the authored document can be delivered in SMIL or
      CMIF formats.<P>

      The authoring tool runs on the MS-Windows NT/95, Sun Solaris SGI
      IRIX and Apple Macintosh platforms.<P>

       Presentation tools for the SMIL and CMIF format are provided for
      the MS-Windows NT/95, Sun Solaris, SGI IRIX, and Apple Macintosh
      platforms.<P>

      The presentation tools may be launched as a helper application
      from WWW browsers, or as stand alone applications.<P>

      The CMIF format presentation tools can present from local files,
      CD-ROM or the client-server networked delivery option.<P>

      SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, pronounced
      &quot;smile&quot;) is a language for describing interactive
      synchronized multimedia distributed on the Web. - Those
      producing HTML format documents for corporate Intranets or
      Internet distribution which require SMIL to support variations
      in presentation formats, and the synchronisation of continuous
      media.<P>

      CMIF - Multimedia Publishers who will use the CMIF viewers for
      MS Windows NT/95, Apple Macintosh or UNIX/X11 provided by GRiNS
      to produce applications incorporating variations in presentation
      formats, and the synchronisation of continuous media in order to
      produce variable presentations depending on the quality of the
      delivery mechanism. This market segment has variously been
      referred to as variations on the phrase the &#145;Intranet
      Corporate Presentation Market&#146; including the networked
      kiosk market.<P>

      HyTime - Large companies producing documents which they require
      to maintain over long periods, in particular military and
      aerospace developers who are contractually obliged to use HyTime
      through the CALS standard.<P>

      MHEG - Developers of digital television use the MHEG-5 format
      for broadcasting through DAVIC set top boxes.<P>

     Particular example applications include -<P>

 	Motor, Aeronautics, Military or other large manufacturers who
	wish to produce documentation including video or audio in a
	standard format which they will maintain for a long period
	(e.g. greater than 15 years) when browsers and delivery
	platforms may change, but the representation standard will
	remain. Companies that now use SGML to store text only
	documents, but now wish to introduce time based media (audio
	&amp; video) into those (e.g. to aid explanation for training
	purposes) are most likely to migrate to HyTime since it is
	built upon SGML and adds hyperlinks and control of time based
	media. Jade is a public domain DSSSL conversion tool which can
	take the HyTime output from GRiNS and convert to PDF, HTML
	etc... HyTime can be used to convert now, or is seen as an
	archival form for conversion later to the then available
	viewers for such persistent documents.<P>

 	Entertainment and Education developers who are producing
	multimedia presentations for delivery over set top boxes from
	the Digital Broadcasting systems conforming to DAVIC.<P>
      Publishers who wish to produce time-based-media rich
      presentations where they require control over the timing of the
      video, audio and other media, and who require distribution
      through multiple delivery routes including Networks, CD
      etc..<P>

      Multimedia authors of any kind who wish to produce applications
      which will be delivered over networks and through CD to a
      variety of user workstations of varying quality of service
      (network and delivery machine), where they require to present
      different assets depending on that quality of
      service.<P>
