      To install you only need to extract the gzipped tar file. <P>

      The GR<i>i</i>NS player may expect some optional subsystems for
      audio and/or video to be installed on your system, see the
      release notes for your platform for details. <p>
      
      Nothing is installed in strange places, except for a
      <code>.grins</code> preferences file in your home directory, so
      you can uninstall the grins player by removing the folder.<P>
