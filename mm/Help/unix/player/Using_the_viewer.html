   <h3>File Menu</h3>

	document is open, closes the current document but continues
	playing other documents. </li>

    <h3>Play Menu</h3>

      The commands here duplicate the <i>Play</i> (keyboard shortcut
      "p"), <i>Pause</i> (keyboard shortcut "P") and <i>Stop</i>
      (keyboard shortcut "s") buttons in the document window. There is
      an extra keyboard shortcut, spacebar, which does <i>Play</i>
      when stopped and toggles between <i>Play</i> and <i>Pause</i>
      otherwise. <p>

    <h3>Channels Menu</h3>

      This menu allows you to selectively disable and enable channels,
      also known as SMIL regions. <p>

    <h3>Options Menu</h3>

    <p>
      The <i>Preferences</i> command allows you to select the internet
      preferences for the system. Here you can set your internet
      connection speed, preferred language and such. This may cause
      alternative content to be played in some documents.<p>
         
    <p>
      <i>Dump scheduler data</i>, if available, is a developer-only
      command to show what the player is doing. </p>
