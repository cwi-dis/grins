    <P>
      To install only the GRiNS player run GRiNSplayer.exe</P>

    <P>
      This will ask where the program files should be placed, and then
      automatically install off the software. It will place a GRiNS
      player Icon on the desktop.</P>

    <P>
      If the GRiNS editor is also needed then run the GRiNS.exe
      file. This will install both the player and the editor.</P>
