The helpfiles are split by program: editor and player. Within each
directory you find a "src" directory which contains all the ForeHelp
source files to create the help file. Building the help file from within
ForeHelp creates a .hlp and .rtf file in the src directory. Move
the .hlp file up one level and you are done.

The rtf file may at some point be useable to create html-based help
files.
