Things To Do, Bugs To Fix
=========================

Save for Player crashes.  -mariat

In 7html:
The buttons Next and Back sometimes are not working when selected.
I think this happens after I edit the attributes of the button and
I don't turn on/off the channel.  -mariat

Randomly, I don't have proper redraws of windows!!!  -mariat

Change a text channel to label. If the player is not turned on/off,
crash when play. It doesn't happen if label is changed to text.  -mariat

Channels are created as soon as you define the type. Could it be after
you give the attribute values and select OK? (There are problems with
the windows).  -mariat
	Not exactly what was asked for, but by making the default size
	of a top-level window bigger, it doesn't get an immediate
	resize event which cancels the box drawing before it started,
	and the window is big enough to actually draw a box.  The
	resize may have been X specific, but then, the editor only
	works under X anyway.


The path used for external anchors is absolute. Need to be changed to
relative. Currently I have to edit the cmif files manualy.   -mariat 27/1/97

Relative path names should be relative to the directory of the
document that uses them and not the directory that the editor was
started from. e.g. I start the editor with a document in a directory
A. I then open another session of the editor with a document in a
directory B. If I try to edit a file of this document (open the text
editor from the info node window) the editor expects to find
the file in A and not in B. 
The same happens when I traverse links with external anchors. 
Playing the document is no problem. It finds the proper files. -mariat 27/1/97

In the mondrian demo, the channel and hierarchy views do not redraw
properly by themselves. However if I press the left mouse button they do
redraw.
Most likely it is a problem of the O2 and not of cmifed (that's what
sjoerd claims!).
The same problem does NOT happen in the tutorials.             -mariat 28/1/97

If two channels have each other as base windows, nothing is shown, not
even a warning.						-sjoerd 20/2/97

Pause a document while it is playing an MPEG movie, then close the
document.  This results in a "hang".			-sjoerd
