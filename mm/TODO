Things To Do, Bugs To Fix
=========================

On O2, when stopping an MPEG movie, the system freezes.  -sjoerd, 27/1/97

In the CarCrash tutorial, crash.aiff is not audible. The parallel
sounds are not played really in parallel.  -mariat

Save for Player crashes.  -mariat

in 6Amsterdam if you click several times on the link to replay it
crashes (it happens in the old system too).  -mariat

In 7html:
The buttons Next and Back sometimes are not working when selected.
I think this happens after I edit the attributes of the button and
I don't turn on/off the channel.  -mariat

Randomly, I don't have proper redraws of windows!!!  -mariat

Change a text channel to label. If the player is not turned on/off,
crash when play. It doesn't happen if label is changed to text.  -mariat

Channels are created as soon as you define the type. Could it be after
you give the attribute values and select OK? (There are problems with
the windows).  -mariat


The path used for external anchors is absolute. Need to be changed to
relative. Currently I have to edit the cmif files manualy.   -mariat 27/1/97
