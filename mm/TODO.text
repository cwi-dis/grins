TODO for Michael :-) 
---------------------------------------------

What am I doing:
----------------

* Push-back bars

* Fix drag and drop and copy of everything.

* Do the is_hit algorithm - test every widget for hittedness.


Priority top-to-bottom.
------------------------
* Audio, Video images in the MediaWidgets.

* Fancy graphics.

* Get Jack to make a routine to find download times for nodes.

* Transition boxes

* Convert all the drawing code to pixels. Floating point numbers are silly and difficult.

* New build for Dick of Snap! and the 2.0 player.

* Rename all the view classes to Widget classes.

* Fix crash when clicking on grey stuff.

* Disable drag + drop of structure nodes.

* Fix bug: paste image node.

* Display the player and the structure view at startup.

* Toolbar or asset box - D&D transitions

* Create templates for Snap! (slideshow)

* Enable Quicktime support

* Traverse through the files and use the options
	in features.py.

* Add nice handles to the par and seq nodes.

Incoming
--------

* Windows media support.
* Configure Eudora to do mail locally rather than to the server.
