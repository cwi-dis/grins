<h1>
UNDO/REDO</h1></center>

<center>(Sjoerd and Alain. Last update: 21 February 2001)</center>

<h2>
1) design issues</h2>

<h3>
Test of differents softwares</h3>

<h4>
Word 2000 behavior</h4>
for each operation:
<br>- stack the operation into the undo list
<br>- clear the redo list
<p>for each undo operation:
<br>- unstack the operation from the undo list, and apply the reverse operation
<br>- stack the operation into the redo list
<p>for each redo operation:
<br>- unstack the operation from the redo list, and apply the reverse operation
<br>- stack the operation into the undo list
<p>notes:
<p>- keep undo and redo into two separates menu entries
<br>- all dialog box properties are modal, and contains (Ok/Cancel button).
It avoids consistent pb with undo/redo.
<br>- you can't undo general preference
<br>- granularity level: word (not character), ...
<h4>
Adobe photoshop behavior</h4>
- manage undo/redo, but keep only one level
<br>- keep only one menu entry (swap between undo/redo)
<h4>
Emacs</h4>
- keep only one menu entry (undo), but behaves like there was undo and
redo
<br>- manage multi-levels
<h3>
Sugestion</h3>
The way that Word 2000 behaves seems clear and poweful enough. In addition,
it's the way of the current GRiNS implementation.
<br>So, we suggest to keep this behavior
<p>warnings
<p>- we have to just check if there is not consistence pb with UNDO/REDO
on dialog boxes
<br>- to evaluate the size of undo entries just to know if we can manage
a unlimited number of undo
<h2>
1) implementation issues</h2>
The most important problems you may still have are:
<p>- To trace all operations which don't pass by edit manager and which
should pass
<br>- Cleanup nodes stored into the REDO list (and into UNDO list if we
store a limited number of undos)
