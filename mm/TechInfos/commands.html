<BR>
Every command, and I mean <B><I>every</I></B> command, has an entry in the global menubar. Ideally we would make the full functionality available through commands (for the disabled), I think the only new commands needed would be select prev/select next/select parent/select first child. Property boxes (and all other dialogs) should have a taborder.<BR>
<BR>
I think we can still fit all this in the menubar, otherwise we may have to go with a modal menubar, where one or two menus (View and Operation?) change when you switch views. I would prefer not to do this, however, it always confuses the hell out of me when programs do this.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to being in the menu commands may be available in &#147;convenience&#148; locations:<BR>
- In the contextual menu<BR>
- as keyboard shortcuts<BR>
- in a toolbar or floating palette<BR>
- as buttons in modeless dialogs<BR>
<BR>
Of these, the first four should preferrably be user-configurable. If this is too difficult for the next release we should definitely have the following choices:<BR>
- Concise contextual menus (jack-style) or complete contextual menus (dick-style)<BR>
- A set of toolbar/palettes that are easy to open/close and a memory for your setting (probably not per document but per user).<BR>
<BR>
By default all views should follow focus. This includes the Node Properties dialog. There should be a way to &#147;disconnect&#148; a properties dialog, though, so you can compare properties. The window title changes from &#147;Node Properties&#148; to &#147;Node Properties for XXXX&#148;.<BR>
The modeless properties dialog would have  Apply/Revert buttons, the modal one OK/Cancel.<BR>
<BR>
We need to think of a grouping of properties, probably in a 2-level hierarchy. Ideally this hierarchy would be used for the propertiies dialog too.</P>
