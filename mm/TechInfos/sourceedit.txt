The source view.
-----------------

The implementation for the source view doesn't look like it's going to 
be too difficult.

An external editor on Windows or Mac simply won't work.

The main issue is how to syncronise the changes. 

- cancel changes

When you have finished editing, you have a choise:
	* Cancel the changes you made.
	* Keep the changes you made.
If the reload doesn't work, then obviously you can:
	* Go back to the editor.
	* Discard the changes and keep the old document.

- edit manager locking.;

When the player is in action, commits to the edit manager aren't allowed.
We could do something similar in the source view.

If the user tries to change something in the document, the source view will
recieve a commit from the edit manager, and could ask the user:
	* Discard the changes in the source view
	* Keep the changes in the source view.

This does, of course, mean that the user needs to close the source
view if he / she wants to make changes to the document.

- keep the current focus.

When the source view starts up, it might be a good idea to select the
nodes which have the current focus.
