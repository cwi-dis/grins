Transitions.

The general structure of how you edit transitions that we have now is probably
okay for a first release, with a few minor changes.

The inTransition and outTransition properties are actually lists of transitions.
The properties dialog should reflect this (a list of transitions, with
add/edit/delete buttons). A complication is that the order is important, so the
list should allow drag/drop or another way to rearrange the items (move up/move down
buttons?).

The transition view should give some visual indication of what the transition is.
For this version I think we have to stick with doing the transition on the
blue-A/yellow-B images, doing it on actual images in the document is going to be
difficult (selecting which ones to use, mainly, and regions etc come in play too).

We should also not forget that only a small subset of all transitions have been 
implemented currently, and things like border/horzRepeat/vertRepeat have not
been implemented at all. We should probably fix this.
