There are multiple Ref elements below. Only one piece of content will be connected to and played. If the URL in the first Ref element fails, the second Ref URL is tried. If it also fails, the third Ref URL is tried. If all three fail, the next Entry or EntryRef element in the ASX, if any, is processed. If there are no other Entry or EntryRef elements in the ASX the user receives an error message indicating that the content could not be found.
End comment. -->
