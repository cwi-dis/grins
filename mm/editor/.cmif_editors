# This file describes the external editors that the CMIF editor can start
# (asynchronously) when asked to edit media-specific data.

# When the user issues the 'Edit' command, a menu of available editors
# for the selected node's type is presented, and the user can select
# an editor from this menu (or Cancel it).
# If only a single entry exists for a particular channel type, no menu is
# presented; the editor is started immediately.
# (Because I personally don't like the latter behavior, I have defined two
# or more editors for each channel type.  Note that some "editors" really
# only display the data.

# File format:
# - blank lines and lines beginning with a '#' are ignored
# - other lines must have exactly three colon-separated fields:
#   = channel type; must be one of the known CMIF channel types
#   = label for the edit menu; leave blank for the one and only default editor
#   = command to execute; sh syntax; use $file to reference the data file

# Three files are read, in this order, if they exist:
#	./.cmif_editors
#	$HOME/.cmif_editors
#	$CMIF/mm4/.cmif_editors [$CMIF default is /ufs/guido/mm/demo]
# Early entries have preference over later entries with the same channel
# type and label string.
# Entries will be placed in the menu in alphabetic order.
