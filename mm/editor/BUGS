------------------------------ BUGS -------------------------------
Timing: (opt)calctimes isn't a very meaningful name.

MovieChannel: center the image.

VanGogh demo: move data to subdirectory.

Player: "late" display keeps old value during initialization.

channel view: deleted arc is still drawn

channel view: add channel complains about duplucate name

channel view: add channel opens wrong channel?!?!

edit mgr: doesn't fix channel dictionary

channel view: doesn't draw thermo on show()

channel view: resize behavior is weird

block view: open/close must be done different; opening something that
had a red button before zooming should open all of it, not keep it
closed... 

block view: resize behavior is weird

player: crash when putting two events on same channel simultaneously
(can't seem to reproduce this now?)

------------------------------ JAMMER MAAR HELAAS -----------------

general: sometimes, after a while the entire CMIF editor hangs...

------------------------------ PERFORMANCE ------------------------

channel view: many double redraws

movie channel: takes so much priority that sound doesn't play and
buttons don't react

movie channel: loading colormap takes ages

form loader: parsing .fd files takes ages

------------------------------ PROJECT MANAGEMENT -----------------

general: need to use CVS for project management

------------------------------ FEATURES ---------------------------

player: "keep" attribute (default 1)

channel view: needs command structure like block view

channel view: need commands to add/delete channels

block & channel view: want to show other view's focus

block & channel view: use channel colors instead of default gray / yellow

------------------------------ NITS -------------------------------

general: need a template for a simple e-mail document

channel view: should display no dialogs when transactions fail

channel view: help is printed on stdout

channel view: uninformative dialog box for unknown keyboard input
(should beep)

block view: should beep instead of pop up a dialog offering help for
wrong keyboard entry (a static help button in the menu bar is a better
way to offer help)

toplevel: sometimes complaint about unknown command when clicking in
toplevel menu while things are busy?

player: should remember & save which channels are "off"

player: when playing a subtree, should make sure that at least one
 	of the channels it uses is on?

------------------------------ FIXED ------------------------------

player: crashes if a node has no valid channel

MMWrite.writename: empty string as name is not quoted

editmgr: deleting attrs that don't exist breaks

X??? FORMS???:	the lower half of the toplevel menu is cleared to white
		when the player is opened, *if* there is an image or
		movie window.  Moving the menu fixes it...
		[turned out that clear() called gl.clear() even if wid=0...]

info window: need a button to edit or create 'ext' data

info window: window doesn't disappear when restore destroys the tree

toplevel: hierarchy button light stays on when view is closed by restore

info window: should be smaller

movie channel: crash when a "2.0" movie is presented

player: color used for clearing various windows (text, image, movie)

need global clipboard module

block view: needs Copy command as well

text channel: font spec should be a node attribute (as well as colors)

text channel: join lines, but use blank lines to separate paragraphs...

need quit dialog if there are unsaved changes (also for restore)

channel info: if you change the channel name, all nodes are disinherited!
(NB: can fix the tree, but not the clipboard...)

channel view: curtim bug

channel view: node focus not redrawn on commit

channel view: 'bad setsyncarcdelay call' when editing a sync arc

channel view: crashes if a leaf node has no valid channel

channel view: if root is selected, focus isn't shown

channel view: open it, then close; open in the block view a node that
was closed; and then 'add' there.  This crashes the channel view...

channel view: doesn't notice when a node has moved to another channel

channel view: draws sync arcs even when an end is not on any channel

channel view: when an existing node that had no channel re-appears, it
isn't drawn

channel view: when selecting multiple nodes, goes up one level too much

channel view: newly added arcs are drawn twice, once with the wrong
timing information (before the commit)

channel view: can't create channels once the last channel is deleted...

text channel: after a while the font manager fails with
"ValidateFont: fmfntread failed."
(Not much we can do about this -- "fixed in IRIX 4.0.1")
