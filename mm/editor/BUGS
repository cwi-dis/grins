-------------------------- LYNDA'S NOTES --------------------------

*    Menus in hierarchy and time chart window are different:
     In Time chart you can use the right mouse button anywhere in the
     window.  In the Hierarchy you need to go to the menu.
     (Shortcuts are the same?)
     The reason is that the Hierarchy window was produced with the Forms
     library.

*    The ordering of channels in the Time chart window cannot be changed.
     (I had wanted to put a frequently occurring channel next tot he two
     which are always there.)

*    I hadn't noticed that there was a visual difference between leaf nodes
     and non-leaf nodes in the Hierarchy view.  Leaf nodes have their names
     in the middle.  Non-leaf nodes have their names at the top, and have a
     small box top left.

*    It would be nice to see, in the Hierarchy window, which nodes have their
     time explicitly defined.  However, there are perhaps more things which
     could be shown in the window, and a list of priorities could usfully be
     made. 
     
*    Some of the information in "Node Attribute" and "Node Information" is
     the same, but the format is different.  This is because the desired
     methods of editing the attributes haven't been implmented.

*    It would be nice if the user could change the automatically specified
     width of the parallel nodes in the Hierarchy window.
     One solution would be to take into account the number of channels
     involved with each node and to divide the width accordingly.

*    I was unable to use the input text box for Immediate text without
     further (human) help. The interface is very strange.

*    I wanted to be able to change the node type
                                  *** of many similar nodes ***
                                                 later.  This is because I
     want to draw some pictures, but until then I want a temporary text
     window.  This is possible by creating a style and making the channel
     part of the style information.

------------------------------ BUGS -------------------------------

Player: crash if playing node with undefined channel

?: turning borders off for a channel might affect the wrong window

all: When a FORM is iconified, things hang.

all: When a view FORM is closed using 4DWm's close menu item, it takes
a while before events get handled again.

Timing: sometimes calctimes for partial tree is affects lay-out in
channel view.

Timing: (opt)calctimes isn't a very meaningful name.

edit mgr: doesn't fix channel dictionary

block view: open/close must be done different; opening something that
had a red button before zooming should open all of it, not keep it
closed...

block view: resize behavior is weird

player: crash when putting two events on same channel simultaneously
(can't seem to reproduce this now?)

------------------------------ JAMMER MAAR HELAAS -----------------

general: sometimes, after a while the entire CMIF editor hangs...

------------------------------ PERFORMANCE ------------------------

Timing: takes ages -- why?

movie channel: takes so much priority that sound doesn't play and
buttons don't react

movie channel: loading colormap takes ages

form loader: parsing .fd files takes ages

------------------------------ PROJECT MANAGEMENT -----------------

general: need to use CVS for project management

------------------------------ FEATURES ---------------------------

channel view: want to cut and paste channels

channel view: need to warn if a channel with nodes is deleted

player: "keep" attribute (default 1) [what's this?]

block & channel view: want to show other view's focus

block & channel view: use channel colors instead of default (gray)

------------------------------ NITS -------------------------------

node info: could use a 'convert to ext' button for imm text nodes.

block & channel views: show only 'info' in menu, but support shortcuts
for attributes and anchors.

Need uniform approach to configuration files/directories (help directory,
Attrdefs, .cmif_editors -- what else?)

VanGogh demo: move data to subdirectory.

Player: "late" display keeps old value during initialization.

channel view: need a text box to specify the delay as well

channel view: settings of new sync arc can be copied from last created one?

block view: get rid of dialog on wrong character

general: need a template for a simple e-mail document

block view: should beep instead of pop up a dialog offering help for
wrong keyboard entry (a static help button in the menu bar is a better
way to offer help)

toplevel: sometimes complaint about unknown command when clicking in
toplevel menu while things are busy?

player: when playing a subtree, should make sure that at least one
 	of the channels it uses is on?

------------------------------ FIXED ------------------------------

player: crashes if a node has no valid channel

MMWrite.writename: empty string as name is not quoted

editmgr: deleting attrs that don't exist breaks

X??? FORMS???:	the lower half of the toplevel menu is cleared to white
		when the player is opened, *if* there is an image or
		movie window.  Moving the menu fixes it...
		[turned out that clear() called gl.clear() even if wid=0...]

info window: need a button to edit or create 'ext' data

info window: window doesn't disappear when restore destroys the tree

toplevel: hierarchy button light stays on when view is closed by restore

info window: should be smaller

movie channel: crash when a "2.0" movie is presented

player: color used for clearing various windows (text, image, movie)

need global clipboard module

block view: needs Copy command as well

text channel: font spec should be a node attribute (as well as colors)

text channel: join lines, but use blank lines to separate paragraphs...

need quit dialog if there are unsaved changes (also for restore)

channel info: if you change the channel name, all nodes are disinherited!
(NB: can fix the tree, but not the clipboard...)

channel view: curtim bug

channel view: node focus not redrawn on commit

channel view: 'bad setsyncarcdelay call' when editing a sync arc

channel view: crashes if a leaf node has no valid channel

channel view: if root is selected, focus isn't shown

channel view: open it, then close; open in the block view a node that
was closed; and then 'add' there.  This crashes the channel view...

channel view: doesn't notice when a node has moved to another channel

channel view: draws sync arcs even when an end is not on any channel

channel view: when an existing node that had no channel re-appears, it
isn't drawn

channel view: when selecting multiple nodes, goes up one level too much

channel view: newly added arcs are drawn twice, once with the wrong
timing information (before the commit)

channel view: can't create channels once the last channel is deleted...

text channel: after a while the font manager fails with
"ValidateFont: fmfntread failed."
("fixed in IRIX 4.0.1" --- indeed)

time chart: when the player is stopped, active or armed nodes aren't reset.

top level: should close help window on "Restore"

player: should remember & save which channels are "off"

image channel: bad image file (e.g. /dev/null) causes exit(0)

channel view: need commands to add/delete channels

channel attr: crash when applying 'reset' to channel name

(- - - channel view rewritten - - -)

channel view: deleted arc is still drawn

channel view: add channel complains about duplucate name

channel view: add channel doesn't make the new channel the focus

channel view: doesn't draw thermo on show()

channel view: resize behavior is weird

channel view: many double redraws

channel view: new channel, new arc should select & open info for the new object

channel view: open info window on new sync arc

channel view: needs command structure like block view

channel view: get rid of dialog on wrong character

channel view: should display no dialogs when transactions fail

channel view: help is printed on stdout

channel view: uninformative dialog box for unknown keyboard input
(should beep)

arc edit: larger delay range

MovieChannel: center the image.

*    I would very much like to see unused channels not appear on the
     screen.  So that text windows can appear where the film window was,
     and so on.  Otherwise all the channels have to occupy different places
     on the screen, and only half are ever used at any one time, and the
     presentation has no cohesion.
     *** solution: channel windows pop up when a new node is displayed ***
