channel view: crashes if a leaf node has no valid channel

channel view: if root is selected, focus isn't shown

channel view: open it, then close; open in the block view a node that
was closed; and then 'add' there.  This crashes the channel view...

channel view: doesn't notice when a node has moved to another channel

player: crash when putting two events on same channel simultaneously

block view: resize behavior is weird

channel view: resize behavior is weird

------------------------------ FEATURES ---------------------------

quit dialog if there are unsaved changes

player: "keep" attribute (default 1)

player: color used for clearing various windows (text, image, movie)

text channel: font spec should be a node attribute (as well as colors)

block view: needs Copy command as well

channel view: needs command structure like block view

channel view: need commands to add/delete channels

block & channel view: want to show other view's focus

need global clipboard module

------------------------------ NITS -------------------------------

player: should remember & save which channels are "off"

player: when playing a subtree, should make sure that at least one
 	of the channels it uses is on?

------------------------------ FIXED ------------------------------

player: crashes if a node has no valid channel

MMWrite.writename: empty string as name is not quoted

editmgr: deleting attrs that don't exist breaks

X??? FORMS???:	the lower half of the toplevel menu is cleared to white
		when the player is opened, *if* there is an image or
		movie window.  Moving the menu fixes it...
		[turned out that clear() called gl.clear() even if wid=0...]

info window: need a button to edit or create 'ext' data

info window: window doesn't disappear when restore destroys the tree

toplevel: hierarchy button light stays on when view is closed by restore

info window: should be smaller

movie channel: crash when a "2.0" movie is presented
