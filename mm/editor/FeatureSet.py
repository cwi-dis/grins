# This file contains features for the various features available
# in GRiNS. This is an enumerated list of individual features only.
#
# These are enabled and disabled in <product>/features.py by including
# or not including them in the feature_set list.
#
# For large segments of code, it is much better to use an import statement
# where the PYTHONPATH is used to determine which file to import.
#
# To use them within the source code, test for their presence in the feature_set
# list.
