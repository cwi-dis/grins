This is (will be, at least) the integrated version of the MM editor.
I am collecting the different views (player, block view and channel
view) and will glue them together with a little menu that allows the
user to open and close individual views and to quit.  Saving may also
be a possibility.


main.py			Main program for testing the MM editor.

Player.py		The viewer, or presentation view.  This lets
			you play, pause and stop the presentation.
			It also lets you edit the attributes of the
			root node, but this is not particularly useful.

BlockView.py		RobertL's block view.  I try to minimize the
			hacking, but I have to add things like init(),
			destroy(), show() and hide().

ChannelEdit.py		Display a list of buttons, one for each
			channel, and lets you edit the channel's
			attributes.  This should be extended with
			functions to create and delete channels.
			The channels actually use (some of) the
			attributes you set here!  *** This will go
			away ***

StyleEdit.py		A dialog box that lets you edit the style
			dictionary.  Currently you can add, rename and
			delete styles, but you can't edit them; for
			that I still need to make a "style" wrapper
			in ../lib/AttrEdit.py.

Channel.py		Base class for all channels.  Defines the
			interface to a channel and implements a null
			channel.

NullChannel.py		Null channel class.  (This is just a renaming
			of Channel, which already implements dummy
			versions of all methods.)

TextChannel.py		Text channel class.  Currently very primitive
			(prints only one string, no 'grp' nodes).
			In the future, this should also incorporate an
			internal editor for text leaves.

SoundChannel.py		Sound channel class.  This uses the new SGI
			audio board and library, available in IRIX 4.0
			only, on the Indigo and 4D/35 machines only.
			It supports the sound format created by the
			recordaiff utility, but also understands sound
			files created by my tools on the 4D/25.

ImageChannel.py		Image channel class.  This works by forking a
			separate process that execs a hacked version
			of showimg, taking care that showimg's window
			is placed in the center of the image channel's
			window.  Don't move the window in the demo,
			and don't use images larger than the window :-)


There are plenty of things to do.

One of the most obvious requirements is to give the channels more
functionality (like support for structured and multi-line text in the
text channel).  This is quite boring -- but it has to be done.

Creating an integrated editor for text objects is more of a challenge.

Turning the entire presentation view into something in which you can
actually edit the structure of the document (if it is not too
complicated) is a three-starred exercise.

Problems arise when we want to ensure that views don't allow editing
while the presentation view is actually playing the document (play or
pause mode), and also when we want one view to update its window when
another view has changed the tree structure.  This requires some
global interface that I haven't thought much about yet.

Let's not forget that the real goal is an annotation editor -- we need
a whole buch of high-level editing operations to support this.

Another original goal of the project is portability.  With the current
set-up we can forget that: FORMS requires GL in RGB mode, the sound
channel requires Indigo or 4D/35 sound, etc.  About the only
parametrization left is screen size (Indigo: 1024 x 768, 4D/35: 1280 x
1024), but that's pretty boring.

It should be pretty simple to create a tool that looks through a
document to find out what files it uses, and creates a tar or shar
archive that recreates the document in somebody else's directory.
(This should somehow modify pathnames so all external nodes refer to
files in the current directory.)  When integrated with a power mail
reader like MH, this may make a spiffy demonstration of multimedia
mail...
