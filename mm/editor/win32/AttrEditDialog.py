"""Dialog for the Attribute Editor.

The Attribute editor dialog consists of four buttons that are always
present (`Cancel', `Restore', `Apply', and `OK'), and a row of
attribute editor fields.  The number and type of these fields are
determined at run time, but there are only a limited number of
different types.  The fields are represented by instances of
sub-classes of the AttrEditorDialogField.  A list of these instances
is passed to the constructor of the AttrEditorDialog class.

Each of the attribute editor fields has a label with the name of the
attribute, an interface to edit the value (the interface depends on
the type of the value), and a `Reset' button.  There are two callbacks
associated with an attribute editor field, one to get help, and one
that is called when the `Reset' button is pressed.  There are also
some methods to get and set the current value of the attribute.

The base class of the AttrEditorDialogField class must provide some
methods also.
