"""Dialog for the NodeInfo dialog.

There are three different types of NodeInfo dialogs.  Only one of
these can be displayed at any one time, but it must be possible to
switch between the three.  This is always done under program control.
Apart from the variable part, there is also a constant part.  This
constant part is described first, the three different variable parts
are described after that.

The constant part of the dialog consists of the following items:
- An editable text field with a `Name:' label.  There is no callback
  associated with this text field, but it must be possible to read the
  text.
- A list of items of which one is always selected, and which does not
  change over time.  There is a label `Type:' associated with this
  list.  When the user changes the current selection, a callback must
  be called.  Also, it must be possible to set the current selection
  under program control.
- A list if items of which one is always selected, but which can be
  changed under program control.  When the user changes the current
  selection, a callback must be called.  Also, it must be possible to
  set the current selection under program control.
- Buttons, each with their own callback: `Cancel', `Restore', `Apply',
  `OK', `Node properties...', `Channel properties...', and `Anchors...'.

The three variable parts are known as external, immediate, and
interior.  A description of each follows.

The external part consists of an interface to show and select a file
name (actually: a URL) and a button `Edit contents...'.  [ In Motif,
there is an editable text field and a `Browser...' button. ]  When the
file name is changed, a callback is called.  There is also a callback
for the browser button (although that could conceivably be changed so
that the browser is called from within NodeInfoDialog instead of from
the parent class).

The immediate part consists of an editable text area.  There are no
callbacks associated with this text area, but it must be possible to
read the text.

The internal part consists of a list of items.  It must be possible to
select one item and get the selection programmatically.  There must be
an interface to 'open' the selection (double clicking, `Open...'
button, whatever) at which time a callback is called.
