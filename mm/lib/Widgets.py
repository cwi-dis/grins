# Status: all code not run yet. Just written. Bug-free. Yea, right.

# The Widget class provides a framework for having multiple editable
# objects ('widgets', if you must) on the screen. Event handling, selection,
# drawing and so forth will be done on a per-object basis.

# Basically, every interactive widget on the screen is it's own object
# (unlike the way the Hierarchy view is now...).

# Coupled with this idea is the document/view (or Model/view/controller)
# paradigm where there is a conceptual object being edited by multiple
# views (widgets) - that is, if you select one view, all other views get
# selected. If you edit one view, the changes percolate to all the other
# views as it does at the moment using the Edit manager. If you select
# an object in the structure view, it also gets selected in the timeline
# (channel??) view.

# We can define a window (as in window with title bar, frame etc) to be
# a container for widgets. The widgets have a z-order and event
# management. There is only ever one selected conceptual object, which
# when selected will make all of it's views (widgets) appear to be
# selected.

# When drawing, the window calls, iteratively, the draw() method on each
# of it's widget. If the widget is recursive and holds instances of more
# widgets, then it calls the draw() routine on each of it's children
# recursively. Sjoerd thinks that each object would ideally have it's
# own window (as in, screen real-estate) but I see no reason why it
# cannot just return a display list which it's parent concatenates to
# it's siblings.

# When selected, it sends a message to the object that it is a view of,
# and draws a frame around itself. We could use handles for resizing and
# so forth - this could be discussed more.

# When right-clicked, each object is itself responsible for showing it's
# own context menu, and feeds change requests to it's associated object.


# Using this paradigm, user interface ideas could be implemented a bit
# easier and tidier. The structure view could be composed of many nested
# widgets. The layout view that Alain is working on could consist of
# image widgets with a z-order and resizing handles, so that images
# could be resized and so forth for the other views available. We could
# have entire widgets glued to the pointer when we drag-and-drop.

# Just an idea... personally I would just like to see simple lighting
# effects on the widgets (it's doable!) - the selected object is always
# brighter than the rest, the distant widgets are progressively dimmer
# and there are vague shadows to distinguish the z-order.

# Following on from this, an inheritance heirachy of widgets would be
# dead useful - the drawing code becomes much simpler. Having a
# different class for the various structure node and media types would
# make the drawing code and click-handling code much cleaner.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The scope of this class is limited to drawing, selecting and handling events for
# an object. No "scope specific" or system dependant code will be here.
