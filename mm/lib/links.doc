Anchors

Anchors are stored in the "anchorlist" attribute on the node.  The
value of the attribute is a list of anchors.  Each anchor has the form
	(AnchorID, AnchorType, AnchorArgs, AnchorTimes)
AnchorID is a string, giving the name of the anchor.  The name is
	unique within the node (i.e., not globally unique).
AnchorType is one of the set ATYPE_* (AnchorDefs.py).
AnchorArgs is usually either an empty list or a list with 4 values.
	In the latter case, the values represent the coordinates of
	the anchor (x,y,w,h), in pixels if integers, relative if floats.
AnchorTimes is a tuple of two numbers, the start time and end time of
	the sensitivity of the anchor in seconds.  If the end time is
	0, the anchor is sensitive for the duration of the node.

In most of the code, anchors are referred to as a tuple
	(NodeID, AnchorID)

Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are stored in context.hyperlinks.  This is an instance of
Hlinks.Hlinks.  This instance has a attribute links which contains the 
actual list of hyperlinks.  Each link here has the form
	(Anchor1, Anchor2, Dir, Type)
Anchor1 and Anchor2 are anchors, either in the above form, or a string 
which gives the URL of the external document to be linked to.
Dir is one of the set DIR_* (Hlinks.py).
Type is one of the set TYPE_* (Hlinks.py).
