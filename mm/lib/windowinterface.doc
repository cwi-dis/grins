The window system interface consists of a number of functions.  Some
of these functions return an object with a number of methods.

All sizes and coordinates are in fractions of the width and height of
the containing window.  On the top level, sizes and coordinates are in
mm.  The origin is always at the top-left corner.

Colors are always given as a tuple consisting of three values in the
range 0-255.  The values are respectively the red, green, and blue
components.

All objects have a method is_closed() which is the only method that
can be called once an object is closed.  This method returns 1 if the
object is closed and 0 otherwise.

Unless otherwise specified, callbacks are given as tuples of two
elements.  The first is a callable object, the secons is a tuple
giving the arguments with which the object should be called.

The functions are:
	close()
		Close all top-level windows and, recursively, all
		their subwindows.

	addclosecallback(func, args)
		Register a callback function that is to be called when
		the toplevel close() function is called.  The function
		is called using apply(func, args), i.e., args must be
		a tuple.

	mainloop()
		Main loop of the application.  This function gets
		events from the window system and handles them,
		calling callback functions as appropriate.  This
		function does not return.

	usewindowlock(lock)
		Use the specified lock to lock out concurrent access
		to the window system.  This method should be used when
		there are multiple threads of control in the
		application that use window system calls.  The lock
		should have methods acquire() and release().

	newwindow(x, y, width, height, title, pixmap = 0) -> toplevel_window_object
		This function creates a top-level window with
		dimensions width x height at position (x, y).  The
		title of the window is set from the title argument.
		The methods of the window_object are described below.
		The pixmap argument is a hint to the windowinterface
		that it may be a good idea to use a backing store for
		the window.  The pixmap argument is optional and
		defaults to 0.

	newcmwindow(x, y, width, height, title, pixmap = 0) -> toplevel_window_object
		This function is the same as newwindow, except that
		the window does not have to be a RGB (8 or 24 bit
		deep) window.

	setcursor(cursor)
		Set the cursor glyph for all windows.  The value of
		the argument is a string with a symbolic name for the
		cursor.  Currently the names 'watch', 'channel', and
		'link' are defined.  The empty string '' sets the
		cursor back to the default arrow cursor.

	findfont(font, size) -> font_object
		This function returns a font object.  The font is a
		symbolic name for the font, the size is the size in
		points.  The actual point size chosen may be smaller
		if the desired size is not available.  This function
		returns a font object, the methods of which are
		described below.

	settimer(sec, callback) -> timer_id
		Set a timer to go off in sec seconds.  The return
		value can be used to cancel the timer with the
		canceltimer function.
		When the timer expires the provided callback is
		called.

	canceltimer(timer_id)
		Cancel the timer with the given timer_id.

	select_setcallback(fd, func, args, mask = ReadMask)
		Monitor the file descriptor given by fd for
		readability or writability, and if the file descriptor
		becomes readable/writable, call the given callback as
		follows:  apply(func, args).  Mask can be the bitwise
		OR of ReadMask and WriteMask.  If ReadMask is set, the
		file descriptor is monitored for readability, and if
		WriteMask is set, the file descriptor is monitored for
		writability.  If no mask argument is given, it
		defaults to ReadMask.
		If func is None, monitoring of the file descriptor is
		stopped.

	beep()
		Ring the bell.

	showmessage(text, type = 'message', grab = 1, callback = None,
		    cancelCallback = None) -> object
		Display the given text in a popup window.  Type is the
		type of popup, used to determine the style of the
		popup window.  Possible values are 'message',
		'warning', 'error', 'information', and 'question'.  If
		grab is set, the window must be closed (by pressing
		the Ok button) before any other interaction can take
		place.  Callback is a callback function to be called
		when the Ok button is pressed.  If cancelCallback is
		given, a Cancel button is present, and if it is
		pressed, the cancelCallback callback will be called.
		Messages of type 'question' always have a Cancel
		button.
		The object returned only has a close() method with
		which the window can be closed.

	Dialog(list, list, title = None, prompt = None, grab = 1,
	       vertical = 1) -> dialog_object
		Display a window consisting of the given prompt, and a
		row of buttons, one for each element of the list.  The
		list is a list of tuples.  The tuples consist of a
		string which is used as the label for the button, and
		a callback.  Grab has the same meaning as in
		showmessage.  If vertical is set, the row of buttons
		is displayed vertically.  Title is the window title.

	multchoice(prompt, list, defindex) -> index
		Display a window with the given prompt and a row of
		buttons.  The list provides a list of labels for the
		buttons.  When one of the buttons is pressed, the
		function returns the index of the button.  Defindex is
		returned when a RETURN is types in the window.

The methods of the font_object are:
	close()
		Close the font object and free its resources.

	strsize(text) -> width, height
		Return the dimensions in mm of the box that the given
		text would occupy if displayed in the font the font
		object represents.

	baseline() -> baseline
		Return the height of the baseline in mm.

	fontheight() -> fontheight
		Return the height of the font in mm.

	pointsize() -> pointsize
		Return the point size actually used in points.

The methods of the window_object are:
	newwindow(x, y, width, height) -> subwindow_object
		Create a subwindow of the current window with
		dimensions width by height at position (x, y).  The
		methods of the subwindow_object are the same as the
		methods of a toplevel_window_object.

	newcmwindow(x, y, width, height) -> subwindow_object
		This method is the same as newwindow, except that
		the window does not have to be a RGB (8 or 24 bit
		deep) window.

	close()
		Close the current window, all its subwindows, and all
		display lists of these windows.

	fgcolor(color)
		Set the default foreground color.  The color is
		inherited by the display objects and by subwindows
		when they are created.

	bgcolor(color)
		Set the default background color.  The color is
		inherited by the display objects and by subwindows
		when they are created.  At creation time of the
		display object, it is possible to override the default
		background color.

	settitle(title)
		Set the window title to title.  This method is only
		effective for top-level windows.

	newdisplaylist([bgcolor]) -> display_object
		Create a new display object.  The display object is
		used to draw in.  At some point the display object can
		be rendered after which it becomes the current display
		object.  When a redraw is requested from the system,
		the current display object is redrawn.  A subwindow
		may have more than one display object.  The methods of
		the display object are described below.  The bgcolor
		is an optional argument.  If it is present, it sets
		the background color for the new display object to the
		given color, otherwise the background color is
		inherited from the window.

	pop()
		Pop the window to the top of the window stack.  The
		system maintains a window stack, which determines
		which windows lie on top of which other windows.  By
		using this method, the application can order the
		subwindows in a top-level window.  By applying this
		method to a top-level window, the application can
		request the system to put the window on top of all
		other windows on the display.  Whether or not this
		request is fulfilled depends on such external factors
		as the window system and the window manager being
		used.

	push()
		Push the window to the bottom of the window stack.
		For more information see the description of the pop
		method.

	setcursor(cursor)
		Set the cursor glyph for the window and all its
		subwindows.  The value of the argument is compatible
		with the argument to the top-level setcursor function.

	setredrawfunc(func)
		Register a function that is to be called when the
		window needs to be redrawn.  The argument is a
		callable object that is called without arguments.

	register(event, func, arg)
		Register func to be called when event happens.  Event
		can be one of Mouse0Press, Mouse0Release, Mouse1Press,
		Mouse1Release, Mouse2Press, Mouse2Release,
		KeyboardInput, ResizeWindow, WindowExit.  The function
		is called as func(arg, window, event, call_data) where
		arg is the argument supplied to register, window is
		the window that received the event, event is one of
		the above mentioned event types, and call_data depends
		on the type of event.

	unregister(event)
		Remove the registration for the given event.

	create_menu(list, title = None)
		Create a popup menu for the window.  The list
		describes the items in the menu.  The title, if given,
		is the title of the menu.  Elements of the list are
		either None, to get a separator between menu entries,
		a string for dummy menu entries (entries without an
		associated action), or a tuple.  The tuple consists of
		thee elements, the first is a string of length 0 or 1.
		If 1, the character is an accelarator for the menu
		entry.  The second element is a string which is the
		label in the menu.  The third element is either a
		callback function or a definition of a cascading menu.
		A cascading menu has the exact same syntax as the main
		menu.

	destroy_menu()
		Destroy the popup menu.

The display object has the following methods:
	close()
		Close the display object and free its resources.  This
		method is called automatically when the window is
		resized or closed.  When the display object is being
		rendered, the window is cleared as a result of calling
		this method.  When the display object is not currently
		rendered, nothing happens to the window.

	render()
		Render the display list onto its window.  The display
		list becomes the window's current display list and is
		automatically redrawn when the system requires a
		redraw of the window.  Only after this call, the
		actual window contents changes.
		After a display object has been rendered, no more
		changes can be made to it.

	clone() -> new_display_object
		Create a new display object which is a copy of the
		display object.  This method can be called at any time
		during the lifetime of the display object.  The new
		display object is not considered rendered and thus can
		still be changed.

	fgcolor(color)
		Set the foreground color of the window to the given
		color.  The default foreground color is inherited from
		the window at the time of creation of the display
		object.

	linewidth(width)
		Set the default line width for boxes and buttons.  The
		width is specified in pixels until a better unit is
		found.  [XXX--what *is* a better unit?]

	display_image_from_file(file) -> x, y, width, height
		Display the image in the specified file on the window.
		The image is scaled to fit in the window, but the
		aspect ratio of the image is kept the same.  The image
		is centered in the window.  The remaining part of the
		window is unaffected.  The file can contain anything
		that the img module recognizes.  The value returned
		are the coordinates of the displayed image.

	drawline(color, points)
		Draw a polyline (segmented line) in the given color.
		Points is a list of coordinates.  The coordinates are
		(x, y) pairs.

	drawbox(coordinates)
		Draw a box in the current foreground color.
		Coordinates is a tuple consisting of (x, y, width,
		height).  The box is positioned at (x, y) and has
		dimensions width by height.

	drawfbox(color, coordinates)
		Draw a filled box in the specified color.  Coordinates
		is a tuple consisting of (x, y, width, height).  The
		box is positioned at (x, y) and has dimensions width
		by height.

	newbutton(coordinates) -> button_object
		Draw a button (box) in the current foreground color.
		Coordinates is a tuple consisting of (x, y, width,
		height).  The box is positioned at (x, y) and has
		dimensions width by height.  The returned value is an
		instance of a button object.  If the mouse is clicked
		within a button, it is returned as part of the
		call_data argument in the appropriate callback
		function.  The methods of the button object are
		described below.

	usefont(font_object) -> font_params
		Set the current font of the display object.  The
		font_object is the value returned by the findfont
		function.  This method returns a tuple containing the
		following information: the position of the baseline
		relative to the height of the font, the height of the
		font, and the actual point size used.

	setfont(font, size) -> font_params
		Set the current font of the display object.  The font
		is a symbolic name for the font, the size is the size
		in points.  The actual point size chosen may be
		smaller if the desired size is not available.  The
		return value is the same as that of usefont.

	fitfont(font, text, margin = 0) -> font_params
		Set the current font to a font in the family indicated
		by font.  The chosen point size is the largest
		available point size which allows the given text to be
		completely displayed inside the window.  Margin is the
		horizontal margin of the window to be kept free.  It
		defaults to 0.  The text may contain newlines.  This
		method does not break lines in order to fit more text
		into the window.  The method returns a tuple
		containing the same information as the usefont method.

	strsize(text) -> size
		This method returns a tuple with the width and height
		that the given text would occupy in the window when
		displayed with the current font.  The sizes are
		measured in fractions of the width and height of the
		window.  The text may contain newlines.  The width
		returned is the width of the widest line, the height
		returned is the number of lines times the font height.
		The number of lines is one more than the number of
		newlines in the text.

	setpos(x, y)
		Set the current position for displaying text.

	writestr(text) -> x, y, width, height
		Write the text into the window, starting at the
		current position.  The current position is updated so
		that consecutive calls to this method result in text
		being displayed consecutively.  The text may contain
		newlines.  Text after a newline is displayed one
		fontheight under the current line, starting at the
		x offset that was given in the last setpos call.  The
		return value is a tuple with the coordinates of a box
		which fits around the written text.  These coordinates
		can be given unchanged to drawbox or newbutton.

	baseline() -> baseline
		Return the baseline of the current font.  This is one
		of the values returned by usefont/setfont/fitfont.

	fontheight() -> fontheight
		Return the font height of the current font.  This is
		one of the values returned by usefont/setfont/fitfont.

	pointsize() -> pointsize
		Return the pointsize of the current font.  This is one
		of the values returned by usefont/setfont/fitfont.

A display object has four different states:
	1	After the display object was created but before it was
		rendered for the first time.
	2	The display object is the currently active rendered
		display object.
	3	The display object has been rendered but another
		display object is currently active.
	4	The display object is closed.
In state 4, only the close() method can be used.  All other methods
will generate an exception.
The clone() and render() method can be called in states 1, 2, and 3.
Calling the render() method while in any of these states moves the
display object to state 2 and the currently active object (if any)
from state 2 to state 3.
Calling the close() method in any of the states moves the display
object to state 4.  If it was the currently active object, the window
is cleared to the window's current background color, otherwise nothing
happens to the window.
All other methods can only be called in state 1.

The button object has the following methods.
	close()
		Close the button object and free its resources.

	hicolor(color)
		Set the highlight color of the button.  The highlight
		color is used to highlight the button.

	hiwidth(width)
		Set the line width for highlighted buttons.  When the
		line widths of highlighted and unhighlighted buttons
		differ, it may not be possible to properly display the
		narrower version after the wider version was
		displayed.  Therefore this method should only be used
		with a different width than the unhighlighted box when
		another display object is rendered after a button is
		highlighted.

	highlight()
		Highlight the button, using the highlight color and
		highlight width.  The display object from which this
		button was created must be active (i.e. rendered).

	unhighlight()
		Revert the button to its unhighlighted form.  The
		display object from which this button was created must
		be active (i.e. rendered).

The application will never get redraw events, but it may get resize
events.  When a resize event is generated, all windows have to be
redrawn since the display lists have all been closed.  Since the
subwindows were created relative to their parent windows, they can be
resized by the library.  The application only needs to fill in the
window.
