Creating a standalone CMIF for the mac.
---------------------------------------

1.  Run macfreeze (PythonPPC should be 32Mb big at least) and create build.maccmif
    folder.
2.  Move to the Python folder as (build.maccmif), and leave an alias build.maccmif
    in the cmif:mac folder.
3.  Merge maccmifed.rsrc into frozenbundle.rsrc (take everything from maccmifed but the
    STR# from frozenbundle). 
11. Run mkattrdefresource.py (from cmif:mac). Put the result in attrdefs.rsrc
	in the build folder.
13.	Copy maccmifplay.rsrc to cmifbundle.rsrc.
14.	Drop cmifbundle.rsrc on EditPythonPrefs and set the search path to be only
	$(APPLICATION). Also set the "Don't show console window until needed" bit.
	Open with Resedit and remove the 'alis' resource, if present.
14. Open the project, set target names to "CMIF ...", set application signature to
    "GRIN", set output filenames to "CMIF ....".
14. Add attrdefs.rsrc.
15. Run and test it.
16.	Repeat step 14 for PPC.

Don't forget to include fonts and such on the cdrom!!
