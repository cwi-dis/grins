GRiNS Pro Editor for SMIL 2.0 Readme
========================================================================

GRiNS Pro Editor for SMIL 2.0 is a general SMIL 2.0 editor for
multiple SMIL 2.0 compliant platforms. Using GRiNS Pro Editor for SMIL
2.0, you may make presentations for RealOne, HTML+TIME (IE-6) and
various mobile variants of the SMIL language.

System Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release of GRiNS is supported under Windows-98SE, Windows-2000
and Windows-XP. This version of GRiNS will work under Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4, but since these operating systems do not support
multiple audio channels or other multimedia extensions, you may
experience problems.

This version integrated enhanced support for Windows-XP, although not
all Windows-XP issues may be addressed in this release.


General Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the Oratrix website, http://www.oratrix.com for more
information on the GRiNS Pro Editor for SMIL 2.0.

This Editor will playback RealMedia items in your GRiNS document
during editing. Because of licensing limitations of the RealOne
player, we are not able to include the various RealOne components in
this distribution.  As a result, you must have installed the RealOne
player on your system prior to previewing RealOne's RealMedia
datatypes.
To obtain a recent release of the RealNetworks RealOne player, see 
   http://www.real.com/player
for details.

If you export a presentation to the HTML+TIME implementation of SMIL
(available in IE-5.5 and later), you will need to have the Microsoft
IE-6 engine installed on you system to view the result. See
   http://www.microsoft.com/
for links to the most recent public build of IE. (Note that IE-6 is
recommended for supporting HTML+TIME functionality.)
