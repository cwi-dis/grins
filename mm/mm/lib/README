The CMIF Library
================

This directory contains a library that can be used to build Multimedia
application prototypes such as a viewer and an editor for CMIF
documents.  (CMIF, or CWI Multimedia Interchange Format, is an ASCII
representation for files containing structured multimedia documents.)

The library concentrates on a flexible 'MMNode' data type, which can
be converted to and from files in CMIF format.

In the directory ../../doc, the file SPEC contains a specification of
the application interface to the MMNode module and the
parser/unparser; the file CMIF there describes the CMIF file format.

Attribute definitions are read from a file (Attrdefs).  This means
that adding a new kind of attribute does not require editing the
parser, writer and other modules -- just the file Attrdefs (and of
course the channel module that implements it...).


Building blocks for a viewer are also placed in the library.  The
current plans for the viewer are based upon the FORMS library by Mark
Overmars.  This is a flexible user interface builder, providing a
large collection of nice looking buttons, sliders, text input fields,
etc., based upon the SGI Graphics Library (GL).  Robert van Liere and
I have created a Python interface to FORMS which is used here.


[Note: I am slowly replacing pieces of the code, making it more
generally useful in the MM editor that Robert and I are designing,
while trying to keep it working.]
