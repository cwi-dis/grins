This directory contains the source for the "audio" package.

This package can read and play audio files of various
formats.  The package can currently read audio files in the following
formats:
	AIFF / AIFF-C
	AU
	WAV
although not all encodings (especially compression schemes) are
supported.
The package can currently play on SGI, Sun (Solaris) and Mac systems.

The package can convert audio formats on the fly (including conversion 
to different frame rates) and can merge multiple audio streams.
Playing a file is as simple as:
    import audio, audio.dev
    dev = audio.dev.writer()             # open output device
    # open the audio file and convert to an acceptable format
    rdr = audio.reader(file, dev.getformats(), dev.getframerates())
    # tell device about format and frame rate
    dev.setformat(rdr.getformat())
    dev.setframerate(rdr.getframerate())
    # read and play the file
    while 1:
	data, nf = rdr.readframes(10000) # read and convert 10,000 audio frames
	if not data:                     # if no data, we reached the end
	    break
	dev.writeframes(data)            # send data to device
    dev.wait()                           # wait for output to drain

Any feedback welcome.

The documentation to the package is included.  To make usable files
from the documentation source, use the mkhowto.sh script provided in
the main Python distribution (run
	.../python/Doc/tools/mkhowto.sh [options] audio.tex
Use "mkhowto.sh --help" to see which options are supported.
