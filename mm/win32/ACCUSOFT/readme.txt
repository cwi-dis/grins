This directory holds AccuSoft tools.

The "Gear" directory contains the "gear"?? DLL for windows.

This is a commercial product, and is not built from sources by GRiNS.

The DLL "Gear32sd.dll" appears in this directory, but should be in
the SYSTEM directory of each client's machine.  The installer does this,
but developers may need to do it manually.
