GRiNS Player plug-in

Requirements:
	GRiNS Player 2
	Java 2 Runtime Environment (1.3)
	

Installation:
	
	Copy grinsp.jar and grinsp.dll to the extensions folder 
	of the Java 2 Runtime Environment
	(usually C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3\lib\ext)

Use:
	Open GRiNSPlayer.html with Internet Explorer or Netscape
	type or paste the smil filename or url of the file you want to open
	press open and the play
	(You can pass also the filename as param in GRiNSPlayer.html)
	

Warning:
	For Internet Explorer you should close the smil document 
	(by pressing button 'Close') before closing the browser. 
	(for Netscape this is not needed).
	It seems that Internet Explorer, some times, does not wait 
	for the plugin to release its resources.
