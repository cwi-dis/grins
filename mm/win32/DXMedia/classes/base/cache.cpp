// Non MFC based generic cache class, January 1995

/* This class implements a simple cache. A cache object is instantiated
   with the number of items it is to hold. An item is a pointer to an
   object derived from CBaseObject (helps reduce memory leaks). The cache
   can then have objects added to it and removed from it. The cache size
   is fixed at construction time and may therefore run out or be flooded.
   If it runs out it returns a NULL pointer, if it fills up it also returns
   a NULL pointer instead of a pointer to the object just inserted */

#include <streams.h>

/* Constructor creates an array of pointers (to CBaseObject derived objects)
   and then zero fills each position. The cache cannot be resized dynamically
   so if the number of objects that you use varies widely during the lifetime
   of the cache then there will be some inefficiency. Making the cache resize
   would be an expensive operation especially with so little to be gained */

       succeed then it should probably throw an exception otherwise there is

   in the cache and deletes each of them in turn. The list class uses a cache
   to manage node objects that are frequently created and destroyed and when
   the list is finally deleted we will also go at which point we also delete
   any remaining node objects. The objects must be derived from CBaseObject */
