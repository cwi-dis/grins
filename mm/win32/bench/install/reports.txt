GRiNS clean installations informal reports:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NT4 GRiNS installation

Scenario 1.1
-----------
step 1: Typical clean installation of Windows NT4 (Build 1381)
step 2: Install GRiNS
step 3: Test GRiNS: 

Notes: 
	i)  The typical clean installation of NT4 installed IE2 
	ii)  The installation installed Service Pack 1 (a CD 1997) 
	iii) MFC42.dll was definitely needed (checked)

Result: PARTIAL FAILURE. 
	GRiNS could display images and html using Webster
	GRiNS could not play sounds or video (there duration was taken to be 0)
	The OS could play a limited set of formats of sounds and videos
	If you select the IE as the HTML browser nothing is shown
	GRiNS never crashed during the tests.

Scenario 1.2
--------------
step 1: Scenario 1.1
step 2: Install Service Pack 3

Notes: 
	Same as Scenario 1.1
	We are now at Service Pack 5 (12 May 1999)

Result: PARTIAL FAILURE. 
	The OS behavior was definitely improved but the new windows
	media infrastructure was not there yet.
	GRiNS never crashed during the tests.

Scenario 1.3
--------------
step 1: Scenario 1.2
step 2: Install Windows Media Player

Notes: 
	The Windows Media Player installed was the one 
	coming with Service Pack 4.

Result: COMPLETE SUCCESS.
	IE4 may install the same infrastructure since it uses all this 
	stuff (not checked yet).
	DirectMedia runtime may install the same infrastructure also.
	The only thing that GRiNS hasn't yet was the capability to display
	HTML pages using IE. This was expected since GRiNS code requires 
	IE4 or later and the test machine had only IE2.

CONCLUSIONS

GRiNS can be run on
	Windows NT4 with NT Service Pack 3 or above and
	Windows Media Player installed.
	(To view HTML using IE, IE4 or above is needed)

NT4 alone is weak on media support.
More code and some changes are required if we want an NT4 
without addons to run GRiNS properly (play sounds and video).

2. Win98 GRiNS installation



-------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Win95 GRiNS installation




-------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Win2k (NT5) GRiNS installation
step 1: Typical clean installation of Windows 2000 Professional Beta 3 (Build 2000)
step 2: Install GRiNS
step 3: Test GRiNS: 

Notes: 
	i)  The typical clean installation of W2k installed IE5 
	ii) No DLLs transfer is needed (argument checked)

Result: COMPLETE SUCCESS. 
	GRiNS seems to work correctly with a clean W2k.
	The test included all the views/forms/dialogs and smil docs containing 
	all basic media (text,html,image,video)
