After a first quick look at the python scripts of the cmif editor
application and before delving into details through more thorough study,
I send you attached a file that contains a list of these scripts each
one accompanied with a short comment that indicates the script's role
and function. 

	Please take a look at these descriptions, and let me know if my
compehension about these modules is inaccurate or incorrect.


						Thank you,

			 Editor Modules
	
		        ( Role - Short description)



1. File TopLevel.py
	Contains the TopLevel class which represents the toplevel dialog of the editor. Callback functions that are activated whenever a button of this dialog is pressed are also implemented in this file. The TopLevel class is also responsible for creating and destroying the various instances of classes 
that respresent the various views if the cmif document in the editor.


2.File  AnchorEdit.py
	This file provides functionality for editing anchors for a specific node. The AnchorEdit class encapsulates the function of the dialog interface used for editing an anchor for a specific node.


3.File ArcInfo.py
	?

4.File AttrEdit.py
	This file contains classes and interfaces related to the dialog used to edit a node's attributes. The AnchorEdit class represents the dialog for attributes editing, while other classes and interfaces serve as components of this dialog (e.g choice lists) and facilitate related operations (e.g retrival of appropriate attributes)

5.File ChannelView.py
	This file implements the interface of the Channel View of the CMIF presentation and conatins  code that allows every operation of the Channel View to be performed.

6.File HierarchyView.py
	Implements the user interface of the Hierarchy View of a CMIF document as well as the related operations on nodes of the document which may be performed in the context of the Hierarchy view.

7.File Help.py
	Displays Help topics either form a local or from a remote (www?) library.

8.File  LinkEdit.py
	Contains the dialog class that allows editing of links

9. File main.py
	The starting point of the cmif editor. Contains the Main class which invokes the TopLevel constructor for the cration of the TopLevel editor dialog.

10.File MMNode.py
	Contains classes responsible for the manipulation of the nodes of a cmif document and their relationships to channels. These classes act in the background, as every call for an operation on nodes (such as cutting, copying, pasting e.t.c) end up calling methods of this file.

11. File NodeInfo.py
	The NodeInfo class is defined and implemented in this file. This class represents the dialog that displays a node's information and allows for related operations.

12. File Player.py
	Contains the class that represents the player window as  is and functions in the context of the cmif editor application

13. File PlayerCore.py
	Derived from Selecter the PlayerCore class is the base class for Player and has methods that do the actual player work, whereas the Player class methods provide handling for user operations on the player window (within the editor application)

14. File StyleSheet.py
	??? The code that creates instnce of the StyleSheet class in TopLevel.py has been commented out. (We possible don't see any Style Sheet in our irix?)

15. File ViewDialog.py
	Holds ViewDialog class which serves as a base class for view dialog classes. Provides geometry loading and saving.

16. File X_window.py
	Extends the player's windowinterface functinality in order to fulfill the window inteface requirements for the editor application. Conatains classes such as _Window, _DisplayList which are based on corresponding classes of the X_windowinterface, and are enhanced with new features that are peculiar to the editor windows (e.g additional event handling, new button interface).  New Dialog-Button classes as well as other assistant classes   are defined in the scope of this file.
