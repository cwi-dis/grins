# GRiNS and CMIF

This repository exists purely for historical interest. It contains a number of multimedia playback and editing systems created by the CWI Multimedia group (1991-1998), Oratrix Development BV (1998-2002) and its successors at CWI.

This repository has been created by converting the original CVS repository to
Mercurial and the imported into git. 

The main branch is "default" and contains most interesting material. (The "SMIL30" branch is newer, and contains work to revive parts of the GRiNS Player
to allow playback of some SMIL 3.0 features). In reverse chronological order,
you will find:

- GRiNS Editor, for creation and playback of SMIL 2.0 multimedia documents. Used to run on Linux, SGI, Windows NT and MacOS 8 and 9.
- GRiNS Plater, for playback of SMIL 2.0 multimedia documents. Ran on the same platforms and additionally on Windows CE.
- Chameleon, multimedia playback software used for the Chameleon project. Windows NT and SGI.
- CMIF and CMIFed, editing and playback software for the CWI Multimedia Interchange Format, a predecessor to SMIL.
